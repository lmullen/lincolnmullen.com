This code runs lincolnmullen.com, when passed through Jekyll. Feel free
to use and adopt the design of the site for your own purposes. But if
you do so, please be sure to remove my content (i.e., CV, the `_posts`
folder, and so on), which you probably aren't interested in publishing
on your site anyway.
