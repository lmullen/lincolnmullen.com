# Overview

This code runs [lincolnmullen.com][]. It is powered by [Octopress][],
which is in turn powered by [Jekyll][]. Feel free to use and adapt
anything that is useful for your own purposes. But if you do so, please
be sure to remove my content (i.e., CV, the \_posts folder, and so on),
which you probably aren't interested in publishing on your site anyway.

# History and branches

This site first started as a plain Jekyll site, and then I migrated to
Octopress. The current Octopress version is in the branch `master`. The
old Jekyll version is in the branch `jekyll-plain`.
