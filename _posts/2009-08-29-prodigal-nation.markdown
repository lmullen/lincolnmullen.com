Most Americans do not know the word *jeremiad*, but it is a familiar term to
scholars of early American religion. To them the term indicates a type
of sermon preached in seventeenth-century New England. These sermons
lamented that New England had broken the covenant with God made by its
founders. If New England continued its decline, God’s judgment loomed,
but if New England repented, then it would receive God’s blessing. But
even if most Americans do not know the term *jeremiad*, they are
probably familiar with the genre. In sermons or political speeches, they
have heard the idea that America is a Christian nation that has
disobeyed God and so faces divine judgment. The old genre of the
jeremiad is still very much a part of American discourse.

In his recent book, *Prodigal Nation*, [Andrew
Murphy](http://wwwstage.valpo.edu/christc/murphy.html) has done much to
advance our understanding of the American jeremiad. In the first part of
the book, he gives the history of three jeremiads: the Puritan Jeremiad
in the seventeenth-century, the jeremiads before and during the Civil
War, and the jeremiads of the Christian Right from the 1970s to the
present. Murphy’s book is the first work (to my knowledge) to study the
jeremiad over the entire scope of American history. Murphy has not
written the whole history of the jeremiad—he leaves out revolutionary
America, the early republic and the War of 1812, most of the jeremiads
of the South, and the entire century between the Civil War and the
1960s—but by considering the jeremiad over the long term, Murphy has
given us a better understanding of the genre than can be gained from
examining it in only one period.

In the second part of the book, Murphy analyzes the American jeremiad
with the tools of a political scientist. He cogently argues that there
are *two* American jeremiads, which he terms the traditionalist
jeremiad, and the progressive jeremiad. The traditionalist jeremiad,
which is typically religious, calls for a return to the literal past
through repentance and renewed obedience. This type of rhetoric, which
could be stereotyped as a sermon preached from [2 Chronicle
7:14](http://www.esvstudybible.org/search?q=2+Chronicle+7:14) in
November or July, most obviously fits the genre of the jeremiad. But
Murphy also identifies a progressive jeremiad. That jeremiad, which is
typically secular, calls not for a literal return to the past but for a
renewal of America’s past ideals. For example, Martin Luther King Jr.’s
“I Have a Dream” speech called for a return to the ideals of racial
equality implicit in the Declaration of Independence, the “text” for his
sermon.

Identifying a particular jeremiad as traditional or progressive can be
difficult, given the constant realignments of conservatism and
liberalism in American political history. But by pointing out that two
competing rhetorical traditions share the same genre, and thus some of
the same basic assumptions, Murphy has provided a key insight into
American politics and religion, both present and historical. Perhaps
that insight can contribute to refuting the false assumptions of the
jeremiad tradition, and to bridging the increasing gap between
conservatives and liberals in political discourse.
