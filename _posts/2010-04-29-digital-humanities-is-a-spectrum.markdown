title: "Digital Humanities Is a Spectrum; or, We&#8217;re All Digital Humanists Now"
category: essays
---


Digital humanities is a spectrum. To put it another way, all humanities scholars use digital practices and concepts to one degree or another, even those who do not identify as digital humanists. Working as a digital humanist is _not_ one side of a binary, the other side of which is working as a traditional scholar.

Consider a few examples: one historian keeps notes and transcribed documents in MS Word documents so that they can be searched. A literary scholar uses a print-on-demand machine to get a physical copy of a book or newspaper scanned by Google. A medievalist uses a library or archive website to read a document that would otherwise require a trip to Europe. A professor making assignments for a class posts readings to Blackboard. A graduate student in a hurry uses Amazon's "Look Inside" feature to verify a footnote. A history department circulates papers for a workshop via e-mail.

These examples are all done by scholars every day. The examples are unremarkable: using these methods does not imply that the scholar works in the digital humanities. They are unremarkable, though, because they are ubiquitous.

Moving from these practices to the digital humanities is a difference of degree, not of kind. It's only one step from searching Word documents to using <a href="http://zotero.org">Zotero</a>, and from there it is only a few more steps to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_mining">text mining</a>. A scholar who uses online digital collections is that much closer to curating an online collection, perhaps using <a href="http://omeka.net/">Omeka.net</a>. A professor who can post readings to Blackboard can create a course website using <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a>. Circulating papers for comment via e-mail might be a second cousin to <a href="http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/mcpress/plannedobsolescence/">posting your manuscript online for comment</a>, but the two types of review are related.

My argument that all scholars now use digital practices to some degree is not to miss how the digital humanities fundamentally transform scholarship. I'm simply arguing that we're already being transformed---all of us.

Defining digital humanities as a spectrum might help resolve one of the contradictions I see in discussion of the digital humanities. On the one hand, these discussions often lament the barriers between digital scholars and traditional scholars, with worries about how new scholarship can be recognized as valid and how digital humanists can be tenured. I do not want to minimize these concerns at all; they are some of the pressing problems of the digital humanities. But the solution to these problems is not a rhetoric of binary. I think the answer will come from what is, on the other hand, digital humanities' ethos of inclusion. It's the ethos that says, I'm a coder and you're not, so <a href="http://thatcamp.org/2010/who-wants-to-be-a-hacker/">let me teach you</a>, or <a href="http://oneweekonetool.org/">let me build the tools you need</a>. It's the ethos that says texts and tools should be available for all and that publicly funded research and instruction should be publicly accessible.

This concept of a spectrum can turn the ethos of inclusion into a tool of persuasion. Does someone question whether digital humanities work counts as scholarship? Demonstrate how the work advances or refines techniques implicit in more traditional scholarship. Does a scholar doubt the value of identifying as a digital humanist? Point out how that scholar is already using digital methods and concepts.

In other words: we're all digital humanists now. Persuading other scholars of that is a way to spread what is best in the ethos of digital humanities.

Lincoln, I think this blog entry is absolutely fabulous, and your point about the spectrum of digital humanities is great (I'm about to support another round of workshops on technology for grad students, and I think your point about the various types of digital research/processes is useful to think about. We get participants on the spectrum: some are very tech-savvy, others are very tech-skeptical.)

Also, this was great for me. I've considered myself a dabbler on the edges of DH for several years. I did some support for a couple of digital projects (in their early stages), but I lack the programming skills and didn't get the opportunity to participate in those projects to the extent I would have liked. Twitter makes me feel like I can be part of the community, if even on the fringes. Someday, I hope to be fully in, not just on the fringes, though --- and your post reminds me that my own digital processes include me in DH, too.

So, I just 'discovered' this world of digital humanities a couple of months ago.  It's funny because I wrote my entire master's thesis using online archives and digital 19th century periodicals.  I used text mining to find articles that no one in my field had thought to use to tell a historical narrative.

In the seminar paper dry runs of my diss. research I've turned back to digital archives three or four times because I obviously wasn't going to travel to a brick and mortar archive for such pilot projects.

When I happened upon some stuff on digital humanities---through ProfHacker and the recent chatter around Emory---I realized that I didn't need to become a digital humanist---I already was one!  I think  more and more of my generation (I'm 26) of scholars will begin to see that, as you say, the binary just doesn't hold water.

I agree with Patrick on that "ethos of inclusion" phrase, it does perfectly capture the spirit.

Speaking from the "digital" side, it's been fun to watch our attitudes evolve too:  from "computers and humanities" --- where the main issue was text encoding, with XML and other standards finally emerging, to "digital humanities", where the idea of a digital document has become so widely accepted that we have have the luxury of thinking about what to _do_ with them --- mine, organize, discuss, share &#8230;

Although it's interesting to think about this in relation to Steve Ramsay's recent paper on Digital Humanities Centers: arguing for a more "pure research" role for DHCs, he jokes that Peace Studies centers aren't expected to ensure peaceful meetings in the German department.

I like the "ethos of inclusion" phrase --- I think it very well captures the spirit of digital humanities and events like THATCamp.

Part of the reason that I proposed the Who Wants to be a Hacker? session is not just to teach people about code and how it works, but to have people at least see and get a handle on what coders do in order to help people be better able to talk to coders, to know a little more of how they/we think. That way it will be easier to blur those boundaries and include people with more kinds of backgrounds (#alt-ac) into the "digital humanities" fold.

<p>[...] I'm going to step around Ramsay's argument here (though I recommend reading the thoughtful discussion that ensued on Ramsay's blog). I mention Ramsay simply as an illustrative example of the various tensions within the digital humanities. There are others too: teaching vs. research, universities vs. liberal arts colleges, centers vs. networks, and so on. I see the presence of so many divides---which are better labeled as perspectives---as a sign that there are many stakeholders in the digital humanities, which is a good thing. We're all in this together, even when we're not. [...]</p>
