As John Grigg observes, David Brainerd is second only to Jonathan Edwards
in evangelicals’ memory of the Great Awakening. His often-republished
diary has been a staple of evangelical devotional literature since
Edwards published his *Life of Brainerd*in 1749. Academic historians
take note of Brainerd too, both for his role in the controversies
surrounding the Awakening and for his missionary efforts among the
Delaware Indians. Grigg’s *The Lives of David Brainerd* is a history of
both Brainerds. The book’s first section contains a careful
reconstruction of Brainerd’s life, while the second section examines the
memory of Brainerd since his death.

To write his life of Brainerd, Grigg has recovered fragments and leaves
of Brainerd’s writings, very little of which is extant. He fills in the
details with accounts of Brainerd’s hometown, of Yale, and of other
missionary efforts to the Indians. Grigg’s argument is that Brainerd
stood uneasily on the boundary between the radical and the moderate
supporters of the Great Awakening. Brainerd’s expulsion from Yale was
not precipitated solely by his intemperate outbursts against Yale
leaders, but was a consequence of Brainerd’s attempt to minister to New
Haven’s separatist congregation while trying to receive the imprimatur
of a Yale degree. Nor was Brainerd forced into a mission to the Indians
because he could not get a ministerial position. Rather, Brainerd turned
down two offers of a position to continue his mission. Brainerd
intentionally based his missions work on a mix of the radical and
moderate Awakening. By the time of his death, Brainerd had mostly
learned to shed the racist assumptions of his day and to think of people
in terms of religion and not race, identifying himself with “godly
Indians” rather than “white heathens.”

Grigg’s history of the memory of Brainerd runs from his death to the
late twentieth century. He demonstrates that Jonathan Edwards used his
*Life of Brainerd* as an argument in several debates, presenting
Brainerd as an opponent of the enthusiastic excesses of the Awakening,
as a denouncer of Arminianism, and as a model of life after conversion
for his congregants. John Wesley, on the other hand, did his own editing
of Brainerd’s journals to provide a model to itinerant Methodists of a
minister who was unmarried, ascetic, a proper steward of money, and
inured to hardship. Early nineteenth-century evangelicals, notably
William Carey in Britain and Adoniram Judson in the United States, also
claimed Brainerd, adding a mythical bethrothal between Brainerd and
Jerusha Edwards in support of their belief that missionaries should be
married. The student missionary movement at the turn of the twentieth
century, led by men such as E. M. Bounds and A. J. Gordon, held up
Brainerd as a model of prayer. In the second half of the twentieth
century, Brainerd inspired missionaries like Jim Eliot, and also stood
as a prototype of the campus radical and the civil rights leaders. Grigg
thus uses Brainerd’s to reveal significant changes in American
evangelicalism and missions.

This book is a revised dissertation, and readers unaccustomed to the
genre will be jarred by the historiographical debates, not all of which
have been excised from the main text. Because Grigg is obligated by the
scarcity of Brainerd’s writings to turn to other sources, the text
occasionally wanders from its topic, as in the needlessly long summary
of Edwards’s writings. One wishes that the author had not been so
generous with people who made up the versions of Brainerd out of whole
cloth as to insist that there runs a “thread of truth beneath the
surface” (190) of their fabrications.

Quibbles aside, Grigg’s book is precisely the critical study of Brainerd
that has been needed by both historians and evangelicals. As such, it is
likely to become the standard work on Brainerd.
