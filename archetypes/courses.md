This syllabus may be updated online as necessary. The online version of this syllabus is the only authoritative version.

You are expected to participate actively in each class session. All devices are to be used only for course work. 

Students must satisfactorily complete all assignments (including participation assignments) in order to pass this course. You are expected to attend each class without exception. Grades will be reduced due to repeated absences. Complete all the readings before the start of each class. No unexcused late work will be accepted. You must request any extensions before assignments are due, and excused late work will receive a one letter grade penalty unless otherwise specified. No work will be accepted after the last day of class unless specifically assigned. I will discuss grades only in person during office hours.

Unless otherwise specified, you should work on your own for assignments. If you do receive help or cooperate on an assignment, all such work should be acknowledged explicitly. In general, every source that you use should be acknowledged in a note or bibliography entry. Sources must be adequately paraphrased, meaning (at a minimum) that word choice, sentence and paragraph structure, and the order of ideas must be made your own. Whenever you use others’ exact words, you must mark them as such by quotation marks or block quotations with accompanying citations.

See the George Mason University [catalog](http://catalog.gmu.edu/) for general policies, as well as the university [statement on diversity](http://ctfe.gmu.edu/professional-development/mason-diversity-statement/). 

If you are a student with a disability and you need academic accommodations, please see me and contact the [Office of Disability Resources](https://ds.gmu.edu/) at 703.993.2474. All academic accommodations must be arranged through that office.

George Mason University has an [Honor Code](https://oai.gmu.edu/mason-honor-code/), which requires all members of this community to maintain the highest standards of academic honesty and integrity. Cheating, plagiarism, lying, and stealing are all prohibited. All violations of the Honor Code will be reported to the Honor Committee.

Students are responsible for verifying their enrollment in this class. Schedule adjustments should be made by the deadlines published in the Schedule of Classes. (Deadlines each semester are published in the Schedule of Classes available from the [Registrar's website](https://registrar.gmu.edu/).) The last day to add classes is September 4. The last day to drop classes is September 17. After the last day to drop a class, withdrawing from this class requires the approval of the dean and is only allowed for nonacademic reasons. Undergraduate students may choose to exercise a selective withdrawal. See the Schedule of Classes for selective withdrawal procedures.

"Render therefore to all their dues": My colleague John Turner put together an early draft of this syllabus. The idea for a popup museum of religion came from [Richard Newton](https://twitter.com/seedpods/status/952178995583488001).
