This site is powered by [Jekyll][].

Code for the site is [hosted at GitHub][site code], in the spirit of Jeremy Bogg's post ["Participating in the Bazaar: Sharing Code in the Digital Humanities."][bazaar]

I got the idea to use Jekyll from [Jason Heppler][] and [Stephen Ramsay][]. The code for [Jason's site][] in particular was very helpful.

Some icons courtesy of the [Icon Dock][].

This site was hand-coded using a bizarre mixture of [TextMate][], [MacVim][], and [BBEdit][], with a little help from [Git][] and [Github][].
