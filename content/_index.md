description: "Lincoln Mullen is a historian of American religion and the nineteenth-century United States."
lede: "Greetings. I am a historian of American religion and the nineteenth-century United States, often using computational methods for texts and maps. I serve as the director of the [Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media](https://rrchnm.org/), a research center which creates educational resources, data-driven histories, and other open-access digital work for public and scholarly audiences. I am also a [professor](https://historyarthistory.gmu.edu/people/lmullen) in the Department of History and Art History at George Mason University."

**Writing.** If you would like to follow my work, the [blog](/blog/) is the best place. It includes blog posts, shorter link posts, and the archives of my newsletter.

**Teaching.** My courses cover American religious history, the history of Christianity, the history of the nineteenth-century United States, and digital history. All of my [syllabi](/courses/) are freely available.

**Visualizations and software.** While working with computational methods, I often create visualizations or software. The best place to find the visualizations is embedded in my scholarship. The source code for visualizations and software packages are all open source and available from my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/lmullen).

**Scholarship.** My scholarship is often collaborative. I have the good fortune of having collaborated with many of [my colleagues at RRCHNM](https://rrchnm.org/our-people/), and each of the project websites credits contributors fully. But I would be remiss not to mention that I have had particular fruitful collaborations with [John Turner](https://johngturner.com/) in American religion and [Kellen Funk](https://kellenfunk.org/) in American legal history.

For a full list of my work, please [see my CV](/Mullen-cv.pdf). Below is a list of my books (print and digital) and some of my collaborative digital projects, with an emphasis on ongoing work.
