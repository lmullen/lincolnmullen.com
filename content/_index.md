description: "Lincoln Mullen is a historian of American religion and the nineteenth-century United States."
lede: "Greetings. I am a historian of American religion and the nineteenth-century United States, often using computational methods for texts and maps. I am an [associate professor](https://historyarthistory.gmu.edu/people/lmullen) in the Department of History and Art History at George Mason University, as well as one of the faculty directors at the [Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media](https://rrchnm.org/)."

**Writing.** If you would like to follow my work, there are a few places you can find it. Short updates and links go on my [weblog](https://weblog.lincolnmullen.com/), which is the closest thing I have to social media. This website has a [blog](/blog/) for longer, more permanent posts. You can also subscribe to my personal newsletter,  "[Working on It](https://buttondown.email/lmullen)," which is issued very occasionally. My colleagues and I release a monthly newsletter titled "[American Religion @ RRCHNM](https://us14.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=36898c6824a31b8e1d4434a55&id=18c732c256)," about our digital history work.

**Teaching.** My courses cover American religious history, the history of Christianity, the history of the nineteenth-century United States, and digital history. All of my [syllabi](/courses/) are freely available.

**Visualizations and software.** While working with computational methods, I often create visualizations or software. The best place to find the visualizations is embedded in my scholarship. The source code for visualizations and software packages are all open source and available from my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/lmullen).

**Scholarship.** My scholarship is often collaborative. I have the good fortune of having collaborated with many of [my colleagues at RRCHNM](https://rrchnm.org/our-people/), and each of the project websites credits contributors fully. But I would be remiss not to mention that I have had particular fruitful collaborations with [John Turner](https://johngturner.com/) in American religion and [Kellen Funk](https://kellenfunk.org/) in American legal history.

For a full list of my work, please [see my CV](http://files.lincolnmullen.com/Mullen-cv.pdf). Below is a list of my books (print and digital) and some of my collaborative digital projects, with an emphasis on ongoing work.
