I am a historian of American religion and the nineteenth-century United States, with expertise in computational methods for texts and maps. I serve as an [associate professor](https://historyarthistory.gmu.edu/people/lmullen) in the [Department of History and Art History](https://historyarthistory.gmu.edu/) at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, where I [teach courses](/teaching/) on digital history, American religious history, the nineteenth-century United States, and the history of Christianity. I am also [the director of computational history](https://rrchnm.org/author/lincoln-mullen/) at the [Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media](https://rrchnm.org/).

My first **book**, [*The Chance of Salvation: A History of Conversion in America*](http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674975620), was published by Harvard University Press in 2017. My **current research** is focused on *America's Public Bible*, a large-scale text analysis of the use of the Bible in American newspapers. A [prototype](http://americaspublicbible.org/) of the project is available online, and it will be published as a digital monograph by Stanford University Press. With a team at RRCHNM I am working on projects called [*Mapping Early American Elections*](http://earlyamericanelections.org/) and [*Mapping American Religious Ecologies*](http://religiousecologies.org/), among other things.
