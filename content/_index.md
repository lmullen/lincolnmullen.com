If you would like to follow my work, there are a few places you can find it. Short updates and links go on my [weblog](https://weblog.lincolnmullen.com/), which is the closest thing I have to social media. This website has a [blog](/blog/) for longer, more permanent posts. You can also subscribe to my personal newsletter,  "[Working on It](https://buttondown.email/lmullen)," which is issued very occasionally. My collaborators and I release a monthly newsletter titled "[American Religion @ RRCHNM](https://us14.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=36898c6824a31b8e1d4434a55&id=18c732c256)," about our digital history work.

I [teach courses](/courses/) on American religious history, the history of Christianity, the nineteenth-century United States, and digital history. 

**Scholarship**. Here are some things I've worked on:

- John Turner and I are working with a team at RRCHNM on a project we call [*American Religious Ecologies*](http://religiousecologies.org). We are currently working on [digitizing](https://rrchnm.org/news/rrchnm-to-digitize-the-1926-census-of-religious-bodies/) the 1926 Census of Religious Bodies.
- *America's Public Bible: A Commentary* is a large-scale text analysis of the use of the Bible in American newspapers. A [prototype](http://americaspublicbible.org/) of the project is available online, and I'm working on an expanded version.
- Kellen Funk and I wrote an article called "[The Spine of American Law: Digital Text Analysis and U.S. Legal Practice](https://academic.oup.com/ahr/article/123/1/132/4840258?guestAccessKey=3a271895-4af8-41e8-b3d9-15941dfe0bcf)." Someday we will do more with digital legal history.
- [*The Chance of Salvation: A History of Conversion in America*](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674975620) was published by Harvard University Press in 2017.
- Nothing else I ever do will be as popular as this [map of American slavery](https://lincolnmullen.com/projects/slavery/).
