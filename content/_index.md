Welcome. I am a historian of American religion and the nineteenth-century United States, often using computational methods for texts and maps. I am an [associate professor](https://historyarthistory.gmu.edu/people/lmullen) in the Department of History and Art History at George Mason University, as well as one of the faculty directors at the [Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media](https://rrchnm.org/).

If you are interested in following my writing or other work, there are a few
places you can find it. Short updates and links posts go on my old-school
[weblog](https://weblog.lincolnmullen.com/) (or new-school microblog, however
you prefer to think about it). This website has a [blog](/blog/) for longer,
more permanent posts. Here is a page where you can read about what I am
[currently working on](/now/) over the next month and semester.

**Scholarship**. Here are some things I've worked on:

- John Turner and I are working with a team at RRCHNM on a project we call [*American Religious Ecologies*](http://religiousecologies.org). We are currently working on [digitizing](https://rrchnm.org/news/rrchnm-to-digitize-the-1926-census-of-religious-bodies/) the 1926 Census of Religious Bodies.
- *America's Public Bible: A Commentary* is a large-scale text analysis of the use of the Bible in American newspapers. A [prototype](http://americaspublicbible.org/) of the project is available online, and I'm working on an expanded version.
- Kellen Funk and I wrote an article called "[The Spine of American Law: Digital Text Analysis and U.S. Legal Practice](https://academic.oup.com/ahr/article/123/1/132/4840258?guestAccessKey=3a271895-4af8-41e8-b3d9-15941dfe0bcf)." Someday we will do more with digital legal history.
- [*The Chance of Salvation: A History of Conversion in America*](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674975620) was published by Harvard University Press in 2017. 
- Nothing else I ever do will be as popular as this [map of American slavery](https://lincolnmullen.com/projects/slavery/).

The rest of my published work is [listed here](/scholarship/). Preprints are available at my [Humanities Commons](https://hcommons.org/members/lmullen/) page. Software or data analysis repositories are available at [GitHub](https://github.com/lmullen/).
