title: Paper Machines Visualizes Your Zotero Library
---

*\[This post originally appeared at [ProfHacker](http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/paper-machines-visualizes-your-zotero-library/44056).\]*

In the past few months there has been a lot of attention paid to a [Zotero](http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/tag/zotero) plugin called [Paper Machines](https://github.com/chrisjr/papermachines). Created by Brown grad student [Chris Johnson-Roberson](http://www.chrisjr.org/) as a Google Summer of Code project, Paper machines was coded by Brown grad student [Chris Johnson-Roberson](http://www.chrisjr.org/), and [Jo Guldi](http://www.joguldi.com/) and [Matthew Battles](http://metalab.harvard.edu/people/) directed the project. Paper Machines uses the data in a Zotero collection to generate analyses and visualizations. If you have a sizeable collection of documents with good metadata and full text (for example, PDFs with text layers) then Paper Machines can run its analysis. The most basic output is a word cloud. More advanced analyses provide phrases matching a pattern, maps of place names, annotations of people, places, and organizations. Paper Machines can also perform topic modeling using MALLET.

I ran Paper Machines on the digitized primary sources for a chapter of my dissertation. I didn't do any work to clean up the data, and this is obviously just a first pass without any analysis. But I was impressed by this map of place names, which generated the kind of American-British-German connection that I thought I saw in the sources. But the plot also contains places that I didn't expect, which I hope will be a fruitful area to research further.

For a much fuller description of Paper Machines, you can see the [documentation](https://github.com/chrisjr/papermachines), Johnson-Roberson's \[write up\]\[Paper Machines Map\] at Harvard's metaLAB, or a two [blog](http://web.library.emory.edu/blog/supercharge-your-zotero-library-using-paper-machines-part-i) [posts](http://web.library.emory.edu/blog/supercharge-your-zotero-library-using-paper-machines-part-ii-6) by Sarita Alami from the Emory libraries.

**Have you tried Paper Machines with your Zotero library?**

**Update (11/8):** In the original post I neglected to give credit to Jo Guldi and Matthew Battles who started and directed the project. You can read a post about Paper Machines by Guldi [here](http://landscape.blogspot.com/2012/03/understanding-paper-machines.html).

**Update (11/9):** Chris Johnson-Roberson sends this update about the contributions of the various collaborators: "Paper Machines was coded by Brown grad student Chris Johnson-Roberson in collaboration with historian Jo Guldi, under the guidance of Matthew Battles at Harvard's [metaLAB](http://metalab.harvard.edu/)."
