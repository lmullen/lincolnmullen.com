Today the *JSR* editors ([Mike Pasquier](http://www.artsci.lsu.edu/phil/relig/relig_fac.htm), [Luke Harlow](http://web.utk.edu/~history/faculty/f-harlow.htm), [Art Remillard](http://www.francis.edu/Remillard.htm), and [Emily Clark](http://emilysuzanneclark.wordpress.com/)) published [volume 14](http://jsr.fsu.edu/issues/vol14/) of the *[Journal of Southern Religion](http://jsr.fsu.edu/)*. This issue has a great line up of articles, especially the forum on "Religion in the Early South" guest edited by [Rebecca Goetz](http://historianess.wordpress.com/).

My technical innovation for this issue was generating EPUB and Kindle e-books of the issue. To do so, I used a Ruby program that [I coded](http://lincolnmullen.com/blog/epub-generator-for-jekyll/). The [source code](https://github.com/lmullen/jekyll-ebook) is on GitHub, and I released the utility as a [RubyGem](https://rubygems.org/gems/jekyll-ebook). I was surprised by how many people downloaded the Gem. Sure, the downloads were not in the tens of thousands, but at least sixty people have downloaded the latest version.
