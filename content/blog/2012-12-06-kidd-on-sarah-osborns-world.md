At the Anxious Bench, Thomas Kidd [lists](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/anxiousbench/2012/12/five-compelling-religious-biographies/) "Five Compelling Religious Biographies." Among them is Catherine Brekus's new [book](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0300182902/ref=as_li_ss_til?tag=backwardglance-20&camp=0&creative=0&linkCode=as4&creativeASIN=0300182902&adid=04K9YC4ETX2BKP2BJ0N8&), *Sarah Osborn's World: The Rise of Evangelical Christianity in Early America*, which Kidd calls "the best biography we have on a female evangelical in colonial America" and also "simply one of the best books I have read on the life of an American evangelical, female or male."
