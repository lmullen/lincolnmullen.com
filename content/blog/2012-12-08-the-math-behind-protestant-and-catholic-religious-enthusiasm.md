*Christianity Today* [reports](http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2012/november-web-only/whats-driving-evangelical-enthusiasm.html) a forthcoming study by sociologist Philip Schwadel that there is a growing "intensity gap" between Protestants and Catholics, "with some 56 percent of evangelicals describing themselves as 'strongly affiliated' with their religion compared with 35 percent of Catholics."

At the *First Things* blog *On the Square*, James Rogers [explains](http://www.firstthings.com/onthesquare/2012/12/doing-the-math-on-religious-affiliation) that the gap in enthusiasm could be growing because less-committed evangelicals are dropping their affiliation to evangelicalism altogether, a finding that fits with Pew's October [report](http://www.pewforum.org/Unaffiliated/nones-on-the-rise.aspx) that "in the last five years alone, the unaffiliated have increased from just over 15% to just under 20% of all U.S. adults."
