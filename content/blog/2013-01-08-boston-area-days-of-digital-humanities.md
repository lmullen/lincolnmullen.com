[John Unsworth](http://lts.brandeis.edu/about/org/aboutthecio.html), [Dave Wedaman](http://wedaman.wordpress.com/), and [Ryan Cordell](http://ryan.cordells.us/) have organized four days of digital humanities events in Boston, March 15--19. This is an exciting DH pair of conferences. I'm hoping to organize a panel for "DH the Next Generation" on digital historical methods in the traditional dissertation---more on that to follow. Here is the [CFP](http://nulab.neu.edu/events/dhdays2013/); here is Wedaman's announcement:

> Days of DH is two digital humanities events in Boston, March 15 -- 19, 2013.

> March 15-16, is "DH the Next Generation." Hosted by Simmons Graduate School of Library and Information Science and organized by John Unsworth, it will focus on issues of the Digital Humanities as they relate to graduate students and junior faculty and will feature a mix of formal presentations and moderated discussion sessions.

> March 18-19 is "Days of DH." Hosted by the new NULab for Texts, Maps, and Networks at Northeastern University and organized by Ryan Cordell and a team of others, it will include a grants workshop with the NEH Office of Digital Humanities, a methods workshop, keynotes by Julia Flanders and Matthew Jockers, and forums for local "DHers" to share their work.

> Please share this announcement with any DH centers, departments, faculty, or students you know of who might be interested!
