Last August the Boston Digital Humanities Consortium formed "to pursue shared funding opportunities; organize a series of events; network with digital humanities centers, organizations, and societies worldwide; and encourage local discussion of digital humanities and related topics." They now have a [website](http://bostondh.org) where you can subscribe to their mailing list. They also have the most comprehensive news and calendar for Boston-area DH events, so it's worth checking out. If you want to be able to post events to the site's blog, you can e-mail [Dave Wedaman](wedaman@brandeis.edu).
