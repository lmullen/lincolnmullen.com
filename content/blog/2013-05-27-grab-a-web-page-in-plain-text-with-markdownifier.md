We've [written a lot](http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/from-the-archives-all-about-text/45815) about plain text at ProfHacker, from an introduction to [Markdown](http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/markdown-the-syntax-you-probably-already-know/35295), to using [Pandoc](http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/pandoc-converts-all-your-text-documents/38700), to [creating slides](http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/markdown-and-mdpress-for-presentations/46343) from plain text. One thing I'd like to be able to do with plain text is this: Often I'd like to grab some text from a website in plain text. Copying and pasting into a text editor loses links and italics, while pasting into a word processor brings a lot of junk formatting with it. It'd be nice to be able to copy a website's text in Markdown.

[Brett Terpstra](http://brettterpstra.com/), the creator of [nvALT](http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/) (another ProfHacker [favorite](http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/move-quickly-from-idea-to-draft-with-notational-velocity/35085)), has created a website to do just that. His [Markdownifier](http://heckyesmarkdown.com/) converts a website to plain text, preserving the essential formatting in Markdown.

The service has a few useful features. It can use Readability to strip out all the extraneous formatting. A button will copy the Markdown to your clipboard. And the site offers several bookmarklets so that you can easily use it on any website.
