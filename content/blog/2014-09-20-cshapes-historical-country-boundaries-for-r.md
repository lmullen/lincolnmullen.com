Nils Weidmann has put together [cshapes](http://nils.weidmann.ws/projects/cshapes/r-package), a useful package for R that gives you country boundaries and capitals for the years 1946 to 2008. This package is based on his cshapes [shapefile](http://nils.weidmann.ws/projects/cshapes). (Via [Elijah Meeks](https://twitter.com/Elijah_Meeks/status/513171905549832193).)

This is a nice model for packaging historical geographic information for R. I'm hoping to do something similar for the Newberry Library's [Atlas of Historical County Boundaries](http://publications.newberry.org/ahcbp/index.html).
