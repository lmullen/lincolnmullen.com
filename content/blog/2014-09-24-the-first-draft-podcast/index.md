[The First Draft](http://www.firstdraftpodcast.com/) is relatively new in the small world of digital humanities podcasts. It's hosted by some of my favorite DH people: [Elijah Meeks](https://twitter.com/Elijah_Meeks), [Jason Heppler](http://jasonheppler.org/), and [Paul Zenke](http://about.me/paulfzenke). I haven't made it through the entire back catalog, but I've enjoyed their [close-to-the-metal](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?CloseToTheMetal) discussions of building in the digital humanities. With their most recent episode titled "Tableau is Excel for 2014," it seems like they are trolling me personally.
