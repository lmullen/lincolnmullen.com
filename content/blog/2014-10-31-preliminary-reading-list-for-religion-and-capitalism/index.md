This spring I'll have a chance to teach a graduate readings seminar on the history of religion and American capitalism. This a course I've been thinking about for a long time, and for a number of reasons I think it is worth doing.

The first reason is that the field of American religious history is shot through with (mostly unexamined) economic metaphors. The most obvious of these metaphors is that there was a "marketplace" of denominations or religions in the United States. As a field I don't think we've yet reckoned with theoretical work like Leigh Schmidt's groundbreaking but [infrequently cited](http://scholar.google.com/scholar?start=0&hl=en&as_sdt=40000005&cites=6215439679561589901&scipsc=) essay, "Practices of Exchange: From Market Culture to Gift Economy in the Interpretation of American Religion." Then too, much thinking about religion and capitalism boils down the idea that religion supports (or should support) capitalism or opposes (or should oppose) capitalism. If the "line separating good and evil passes ... right through every human heart," it seems to me that promotion of and resistance to capitalism runs right through most religious groups. I hope this class will be a chance to examine, and perhaps discard, some of these ways of talking about the field.

Second, the class should be a way of integrating disparate streams of American religious history. As I've [written elsewhere](http://usreligion.blogspot.com/2014/03/the-return-of-longue-duree-in-american.html), what I think our field needs most is synthetic work that brings together the rich but fragmentary studies of different groups. There are many ways to attempt this, but to the extent that capitalism is the water in which all these denominational fishes swim, examining how various groups have interacted with capitalism seems like an obvious way to attempt integration.

Third, the so-called "new history of capitalism" is a vibrant and growing field. Witness Seth Rockman's recent essay, "[What Makes the History of Capitalism Newsworthy?](http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_the_early_republic/v034/34.3.rockman.html)," in the *Journal of the Early Republic*, or Edward Baptist's recent *[The Half Has Never Been Told: Slavery and Making of American Capital](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/046500296X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=046500296X&linkCode=as2&tag=thebacgla-20&linkId=FOKQQAFLCAUP5X24)*. Some of the most interesting recent work in American religious history has contributed to this field. One thinks of Bethany Moreton's *To Serve God and Wal-Mart* at one end of the chronological spectrum, and Mark Valeri's *Heavenly Merchandize* at the other, with plenty more in between. Still I sense plenty of opportunity for American religious historians to borrow from and give back to the new history of capitalism.

That leads me to the last reason, which is that there are still many gaps in the history of religion and capitalism in the United States. There are some articles and chapters on Mormons and the economy, but nothing comparable to Leonard Arrington's 1958 *Great Basin Kingdom*. I had hoped to include a book on slavery, religion, and capitalism, but I couldn't find anything suitable (correct me if I'm wrong!). The history of the Catholic Worker movement could be updated since Mel Piehl's 1982 *Breaking Bread*. Eventually I'd like to do some work on those gaps, and perhaps the other members of the seminar will find their own topics of interest.

But it's perilous to point out lacunae in the literature, since those holes might just be gaps in my reading or thinking. So I put the question to you, RinAH readers. Below is the core of the reading list (not a full syllabus, obviously) for the semester, following a one-book-per-week rule. I intend to add a list of related but not required reading to each week of the syllabus. (Very rough start [here](http://lincolnmullen.com/courses/religion-capitalism.2015/schedule/).) And I'm almost certainly going to include excerpts from theoretical works on capitalism by Weber, Marx, Durkheim, Bourdieu etc. What would you do differently? What other works would you recommend?
