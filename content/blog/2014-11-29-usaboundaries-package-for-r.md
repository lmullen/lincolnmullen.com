title: USAboundaries Package for R
---

The Dr.Â William M. Scholl Center for American History and Culture has released a set of shapefiles for historical state and county boundaries from 1629 to 2000 as part of their *[Atlas of Historical County Boundaries](http://publications.newberry.org/ahcbp/)*. These shapefiles are very useful for creating historical maps, so I've bundled them with a few convenience functions as the [USAboundaries package for R](https://github.com/ropensci/usaboundaries). This package makes it easy to make a map for any arbitrary day in United States history.

For more, see the documentation. The package is available on [CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.org/web/packages/USAboundaries/index.html).
