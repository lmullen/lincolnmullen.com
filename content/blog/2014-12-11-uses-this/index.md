### Who are you, and what do you do?

My name is [Lincoln
Mullen](http://lincolnmullen.com/ "Lincoln's website.") and I\'m a
historian at [George Mason
University](http://historyarthistory.gmu.edu/ "A university in Fairfax, Virginia.").
I teach and write about American religious history; at the moment I\'m
writing a history of people who converted between religions in the
nineteenth-century United States. I\'m also a digital historian at the
[Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New
Media](http://chnm.gmu.edu/ "A history and new media center in Fairfax, Virginia").
I\'m responsible for teaching a [graduate course on computer programming
for
historians](http://lincolnmullen.com/courses/clio3.2014/ "A basic computer programming course aimed at scholars."),
for which I\'m writing a book (still very much a rough draft) on [using
R for digital
history](http://dh-r.lincolnmullen.com/ "Lincoln's book on R development.").

### What hardware do you use?

I have a [15\" MacBook
Pro](https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/ "A laptop.") with an Intel i7
processor, an SSD, and 16 GB of RAM provided by my department. I also
use a [ThinkPad
T430](http://shop.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/thinkpad/t-series/t430/ "A 14 inch PC laptop.")
which was my main machine during graduate school. There is an
unremarkable Dell external monitor on my desk. I have an [iPhone
5C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_5C "An iOS smartphone.") but I
more and more dislike using a phone for anything.

I really like my [Timbuk2 Command Laptop
messenger](https://www.amazon.com/Timbuk2-Command-Laptop-TSA-Friendly-Messenger/dp/B0068DTASQ "A TSA-friendly bag for laptops.");
I wouldn\'t change a thing about it.

### And what software?

I used to play around with software much too often. Now I\'ve settled
down with a few organizing principles influenced by Mike Gancarz\'s
[*Linux and the Unix
Philosophy*](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1555582737/ "A book about the thinking behind Unix and Linux."):
I use Unix-style tools and store my data in plain text or flat files.
Everything that I write is formatted in
[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/ "An email-like format for marking up text.")
using the [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/ "A Markdown document converter.")
extensions. [John
MacFarlane\'s](http://john.macfarlane.usesthis.com/ "John's interview.")
Pandoc is peerless for converting between markup formats. I use some
custom [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/ "Typesetting software.")
templates with Pandoc. I use
[Vim](https://www.vim.org/ "A command-line text editor."), often in the
terminal but usually in
[MacVim](https://github.com/macvim-dev/macvim "A Mac GUI port of vim."),
for all text editing. Every project---writing, coding, you name it---is
kept under version control with
[Git](https://git-scm.com/ "A version control system.") and almost
always made available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/ "A Git code repository service."). Almost
every project is built by [GNU
Make](http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html "Software to prepare code for compilation.").
All of that is run through the shell, usually
[ZSH](http://www.zsh.org/ "An interactive shell and scripting language.").
My
[dotfiles](https://github.com/lmullen/dotfiles/ "Lincoln's dotfiles on GitHub.")
and [Vim
files](https://github.com/lmullen/vimrc/ "Lincoln's vim config files on GitHub.")
are available on GitHub.

I used to write in several different programming languages, but now I
use
[R](http://www.r-project.org/ "Software for statistical computing and graphics.")
if at all possible. It took me some getting used to R and functional
programming, but R really is a beautiful language for data analysis. It
is made even better by the \"Hadleyverse\" of packages written by
[Hadley
Wickham](http://hadley.wickham.usesthis.com "Hadley's interview."), such
as
[dplyr](https://github.com/hadley/dplyr/ "An R library for working with data frames."),
[tidyr](https://github.com/hadley/tidyr/ "An R library for tidying data."),
and
[ggplot2](http://ggplot2.org/ "A plotting system for the R language.").
I use [Yihui
Xie\'s](http://yihui.xie.usesthis.com/ "Yihui's interview.")
[knitr](https://github.com/yihui/knitr "A dynamic report generation tool for R.")
package to write and code together in [R
Markdown](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/205368677-R-Markdown-Dynamic-Documents-for-R "A version of Markdown that supports R embedding.").
[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/ "An IDE for the R language.") (in Vim
mode) is my only exception to the rule about using Vim for everything;
it is a very nicely done IDE for R. Even better, I can use the server
version of RStudio on a much more powerful machine, or for teaching a
workshop, and get the same interface. If I can\'t write it in R, then I
use
[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/ "An interpreted scripting language."),
which is also beautiful.
[JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript "An interpreted scripting language.")
is not beautiful, but Mike Bostock\'s
[D3.js](https://d3js.org/ "A Javascript framework for manipulating data.")
is; I use it for interactive data visualizations and
[maps](http://lincolnmullen.com/projects/slavery/ "Lincoln's maps of the spread of slavery.").

For managing citations I use
[Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/ "A research tool."), an excellent
open-source application and web service by my colleagues at RRCHNM. My
notes are written in Markdown, stored in Git, and edited in Vim, but
they are turned into a wiki by
[Gitit](http://gitit.net/ "A wiki system backed by Git, darcs or Mecurial.").

For most websites, like my personal site or my course syllabi, I use
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/ "A static site generator."). Jekyll is a
static site generator written in Ruby so I\'m comfortable writing
plugins for it; it uses Markdown (with a Pandoc plugin) so I can write
in plain text and keep the site under version control. For any kind of
web exhibit or other scholarly website I use Omeka (think WordPress for
galleries, libraries, archives, museums, and scholars).
[Omeka](https://omeka.org/ "Web publishing software aimed at scholars and museums.")
is also created by my colleagues at RRCHNM. If I assign students to
write blog posts, then I use
[WordPress](https://wordpress.com/ "Weblog publishing software."). I\'ve
been really pleased with [Reclaim
Hosting](https://reclaimhosting.com/ "A web hosting provider targeting educators."),
which provides hosting to educators and students.

The ThinkPad runs [Ubuntu 14.04
LTS](https://www.ubuntu.com/ "A Unix distribution."). Whenever I spool
up a cloud or local virtual machine, it runs Ubuntu. I often use
[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/ "Software for building and installing virtual dev environments.")
with
[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/ "Open-source virtualisation software.")
to create development environments.
[Homebrew](http://brew.sh "Command-line package manager for Mac OS X.")
is obligatory for installing development dependencies on a Mac.

I use a few Mac or web apps:
[iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/ "An alternative terminal application for Mac OS X.")
as a terminal emulator;
[OmniFocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/ "Task management software for the Mac.")
for task management, which I could probably use better;
[BackBlaze](https://www.backblaze.com/cloud-backup.html "Online backup.")
for online backups;
[DropBox](https://www.dropbox.com/ "Online syncing and storage.") for
file syncing;
[Caffeine](http://lightheadsw.com/caffeine/ "A Mac menubar application to keep your computer awake.")
to keep my monitor from going to sleep while I\'m teaching;
[QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/ "An open-source GIS mapping tool.") for
GIS work if I really must;
[Transmit](https://panic.com/transmit/ "An FTP/SFTP client for the Mac.")
for FTP and Amazon S3;
[TextExpander](https://smilesoftware.com/textexpander "A Mac app for adding custom abbreviations for often-used text.")
for snippets;
[Spectacle](https://www.spectacleapp.com/ "A Mac tool for moving and resizing windows.")
for window management; [Feedly](https://feedly.com/ "A feed reader.")
for reading feeds.

My open-source or open-access licenses of choice are MIT for software
and CC-BY for prose.

### What would be your dream setup?

I have plenty of computing power and can rent more cheaply. I don't
even have much to complain about when it comes to battery power. I wish
that there was a way to teach students digital methods without going
through the grime of setting up a development environment.

I've never found an e-reader that I liked. I want a device with a
large-enough screen approaching an 8.5\" by 11\" piece of paper that
could read e-books and PDFs of journal articles, nineteenth-century
books, and students papers with equal ease, preferably with an e-ink
screen. Is that too much to ask?

And most of all, I'd like more and more academic work in history and
the humanities to be released online (in pre-prints like
[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/ "Cornell's open library of educational resources."),
or in final versions) in open formats and hopefully under open-access
licenses.
