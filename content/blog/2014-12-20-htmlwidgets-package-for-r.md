title: htmlwidgets Package for R
---

Ramnath Vaidyanathan, Kenton Russell, and the very clever people at RStudio have [released](http://blog.rstudio.org/2014/12/18/htmlwidgets-javascript-data-visualization-for-r/) the [htmlwidgets](http://www.htmlwidgets.org/) package for R. The package is "a framework that seamlessly bridges R and JavaScript." It provides a way to integrate JavaScript libraries, especially for visualization, into R packages. This is intended to make it easy to include dynamic visualizations in Knitr documents or even in the R Console. Eventually I'd like to develop an R package to do this for [Elijah Meek](https://twitter.com/elijah_meeks)'s excellent [d3-carto-map](https://github.com/emeeks/d3-carto-map).
