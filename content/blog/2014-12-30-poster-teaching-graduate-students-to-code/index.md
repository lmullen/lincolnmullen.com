The graduate students in my fall 2014 class "[Programming for Historians](https://files.lincolnmullen.com/syllabi/clio3.2014.pdf)"---Sara Collini, Peter Carr Jones, Jannelle Legg, Anne Ladyem McDivitt, George D. Oberle III, and Amanda Regan---and I will present the poster below at the [2015 annual meeting](https://aha.confex.com/aha/2015/webprogram/Paper17312.html) of the American Historical Association. This post is a (more or less) permanent version of the poster along with supplementary materials.

The projects created by the graduate students in the course, along with the code that they wrote, are available at their own websites. Below is a list of authors and project titles:

Finally, two other links may be of use. The first is the [syllabus for the course](https://files.lincolnmullen.com/syllabi/clio3.2014.pdf). The second is the ongoing draft of *[Digital History Methods in R](http://dh-r.lincolnmullen.com/)*, a book that I began writing during the semester to use as course materials.
