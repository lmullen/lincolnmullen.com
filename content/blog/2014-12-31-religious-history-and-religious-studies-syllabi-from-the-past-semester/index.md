Happy New Year, Religion in American History readers.

<!--more-->

One of my favorite ways to get to know a scholar is to read her syllabi. Syllabi show how scholars put together a whole field. (And probably no text reveals personality as much as the introduction and policies on a syllabus.) Yet unfortunately teaching documents are shared less routinely than our research, so we are much more likely to know a scholar's books and articles than her syllabi. Following the example of Paul Putz's regular lists of new books, I intend to start a posting a roundup of syllabi for religious history and religious studies from the past semester from whoever wishes to contribute.

So here is a list of past syllabi from people who replied to my entreaties. Only a small number replied this first time, but if you would like to add your syllabus to this list, feel free to leave a link in the comments, or you can e-mail me a document and I'll add it (`lincoln@lincolnmullen.com`).

-   Cara Burnidge, "[Religions of the World](burnidge.pdf)"
-   Christopher Cantwell, "[Catholicism in U.S. History](http://cst150fall2012.blogspot.com/)"
-   Heath W. Carter, "Religion in American History" and "American Utopias" both at his [teaching page](http://heathwcarter.com/teaching/).
