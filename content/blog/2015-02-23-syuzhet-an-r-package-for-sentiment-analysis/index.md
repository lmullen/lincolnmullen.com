Matthew Jockers has created [syuzhet](https://github.com/mjockers/syuzhet), "an R package for the extraction of sentiment and sentiment-based plot arcs from text." The [first CRAN release](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/syuzhet/index.html) is available, and the package is on [GitHub](https://github.com/mjockers/syuzhet). Jockers has an introductory blog post on "[Revealing Sentiment and Plot Arcs with the Syuzhet Package](http://www.matthewjockers.net/2015/02/02/syuzhet/)" which has a useful explanation of his method. I've been using the package myself for exploring sentiment and plot in the [nineteenth-century publications of the American Tract Society](https://archive.org/search.php?query=publisher%3A%28American%20Tract%20Society%29).
