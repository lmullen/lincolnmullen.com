The [DC History Graduate Students organization](https://dchistorygrad.wordpress.com) has kindly invited [Mills Kelly](http://edwired.org/) and me to [join them for a discussion](https://dchistorygrad.wordpress.com/2015/03/09/stay-tuned-for-more-information/) on incorporating digital work into history courses.

To help start the discussion I prepared the [handout below](practical-problems-in-teaching-dh.pdf) (PDF), which features the first meme I've ever made.
