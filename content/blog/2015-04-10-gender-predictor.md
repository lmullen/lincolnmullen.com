Here is a simple web app to [predict your gender](http://apps.lincolnmullen.com/gender-predictor/) from your first name using historical data. It demonstrates what the [gender](https://github.com/ropensci/gender) package for R does by showing how the genders associated with names have changed over time.

More on why I made this app when I have time to write about the [rOpenSci unconference](http://unconf.ropensci.org/).
