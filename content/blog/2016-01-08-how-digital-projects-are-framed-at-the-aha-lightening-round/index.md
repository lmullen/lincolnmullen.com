While everyone else is live tweeting, I'm live blogging the AHA's [digital projects lightening round](http://www.historians.org/annual-meeting/resources-and-guides/digital-history-at-aha16/digital-history-lightning-rounds/aha16-digital-projects-lightning-round-lineup). While of course the projects are widely varied in terms of content, they all have something in common. With very few exceptions, all of the digital projects are expressed in terms of a historical argument or interpretation. This is rather different than many DH presentations, which tend to focus on methods or tools or technologies. Why the difference? It can probably be attributed to the way that the context of the AHA meeting pushes everyone to frame their project in disciplinary terms. That is **[a very good thing](http://drstephenrobertson.com/blog-post/the-differences-between-digital-history-and-digital-humanities/)**. And maybe everyone here was in the room for Cameron Blevin's [talk at the AHA last year](http://www.cameronblevins.org/posts/perpetual-sunrise-methodology/), and took his admonishment to heart.
