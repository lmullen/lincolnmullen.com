I was very pleased to learn about this [gallery of extensions to ggplot2](http://ggplot2-exts.github.io/). I hope it becomes an authoritative list. And I'm excited about some of the additional things you can do with ggplot2, including [ggrepel](http://ggplot2-exts.github.io/ggrepel.html) for labels and two different options for plotting graphs (i.e., networks) with ggplot2.
