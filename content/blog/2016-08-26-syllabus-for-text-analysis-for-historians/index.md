This semester I am teaching an independent study for graduate students on "Text Analysis for Historians." You can see the [syllabus here](https://files.lincolnmullen.com/syllabi/text-analysis.2016.pdf). It's an unashamedly disciplinary course. While of course the readings are heavily dependent on the work that is being done in digital humanities or digital literary studies, the organizing principle is whether a method is likely to be useful for historical questions. And the syllabus is organized around a corpus of Anglo-American legal treatises, with readings to frame our work in the context of U.S. legal history.

They are mentioned on the syllabus, but this class draws from syllabi from [Ted Underwood](https://tedunderwood.com/2015/01/16/syllabus-for-a-graduate-seminar/), [Andrew Goldstone](http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~ag978/litdata/), and [Ben Schmidt](http://benschmidt.org/HDA15/), and [Kellen Funk](http://kellenfunk.org/) offered suggestions for the readings.
