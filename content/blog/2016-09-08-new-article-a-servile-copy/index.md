[Kellen Funk](http://kellenfunk.org/) and I have just published an article titled "[A Servile Copy: Text Reuse and Medium Data in American Civil Procedure](http://rg.rg.mpg.de/en/article_id/1040)" ([PDF](http://data.rg.mpg.de/rechtsgeschichte/rg24_341funk_mullen.pdf)). The article is a brief invited contribution to a forum in *Rechtsgeschichte \[Legal History\]* on legal history and digital history. Kellen and I give an overview of our project to discover how nineteenth-century codes of civil procedure in the United States borrowed from one another. (We will have more soon about this project in a longer research article.)

If you are interested in digital legal history, you might also look at [some of the articles](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/law-and-history-review/firstview) which have been posted in advance of the next issue of *Law and History Review*, which will be focused on digital legal history.
