Today is Harvard University Press's official publication date for [*The Chance of Salvation: A History of Conversion in America*](https://www.amazon.com/Chance-Salvation-History-Conversion-America/dp/0674975626//ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=backwardglance-20&linkId=e5f0ffe248efa900c4c3d7cd5b03a47b). The book started making its way in the world about a month ago, so the official publication date mostly marks the release of [the e-book versions](https://www.amazon.com/Chance-Salvation-History-Conversion-America-ebook/dp/B074G1LQ8W/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1503938814&sr=1-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=backwardglance-20&linkId=8364354947eb476e9f5ab30e719d1e01).

The main news about the book is an [interview](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/08/conversions-lincoln-mullen/536151/) I did with *The Atlantic* about the history of conversion. There should be several more interviews about the book at various history blogs coming out in the next few weeks. And at least two people have let me know that they are assigning the book in class this semester.
