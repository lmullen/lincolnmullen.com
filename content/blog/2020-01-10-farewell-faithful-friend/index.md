When I arrived at GMU in 2014, I was issued a fifteen-inch Macbook Pro. [Some people](https://marco.org/2017/11/14/best-laptop-ever) think that model is the best laptop ever made. I don't know about that, but it was certainly the all-around best computer I've ever used. Not to get too sentimental, but a lot of my life happened on that computer. I wrote my [first book](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674975620) on it. In creating [this computational project](http://americaspublicbible.org), its capabilities were strained much harder than could be reasonably expected of a laptop assigned to a history department. I used it to help raise over 1 million dollars in grants. It took far too many flights to conferences and speaking gigs. And I distinctly remember using it to send out an announcement of the birth of my son from the hospital. After delaying the inevitable, I had to return the computer to the university at the end of last semester.
