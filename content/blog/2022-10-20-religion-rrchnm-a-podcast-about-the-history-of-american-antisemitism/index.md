The [most recent issue](https://us14.campaign-archive.com/?u=36898c6824a31b8e1d4434a55&id=fe50f1ad14) of the American Religion @ RRCHNM newsletter features an announcement of our Luce Foundation grant for a podcast on the history of American antisemitism, a new map of male and female preachers in the National Spiritual Alliance, and a new collection of oral histories about the Jewish experience of the COVID-19 pandemic, among other things.
