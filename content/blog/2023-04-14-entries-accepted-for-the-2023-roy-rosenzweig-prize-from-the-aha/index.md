The American Historical Association is [accepting entries](https://www.historians.org/awards-and-grants/awards-and-prizes/roy-rosenzweig-prize) for the 2023 Roy Rosenzweig Prize for Creativity in Digital History. 

> The Roy Rosenzweig Prize for Creativity in Digital History is sponsored jointly by the AHA and the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media (RRCHNM) at George Mason University (GMU). It was developed by friends and colleagues of Roy Rosenzweig (1950â€“2007), the Mark and Barbara Fried Professor of History and New Media at GMU, to honor his life and work as a pioneer in the field of digital history.
>
> This prize is awarded annually to honor and support work on a creative and freely available new media project, and in particular for work that reflects thoughtful, critical, and rigorous engagement with technology and the practice of history. The current prize amount is $4,000, funded by donations to GMU's AHA/RRCHNM Rosenzweig Prize Fund.
