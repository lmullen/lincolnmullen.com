[Greta Swain](http://gretaswain.org)---a PhD student in history at George Mason
and a key contributor to many projects at RRCHNM---has successfully defended her
dissertation. For a long time now I've been
[trying to persuade people](https://doi.org/10.1093/jsh/shab015) to use digital
history methods to say something meaningful about the past, and not to stop with
creating tools and databases. And that is just what Greta has done in a
remarkable way. In her dissertation she has created a fantastic database
tracking the social history of the family of George Mason IV and the people he
enslaved. And she has created a compelling series of maps and network
visualizations showing how both free and enslaved people used the upper Potomac
River for kinship and economic development. Besides being a masterclass in how
to use digital methods for historical interpretation, the dissertation has broad
implications for the understanding the history of waterways and commercial
development in early America.

Below is the title and abstract for the dissertation. As with all dissertations,
it will take some time for the final version to be submitted, but you'll want
look it up once it has been.

Greta is off [to be a postdoc](https://historyarthistory.gmu.edu/articles/19036)
at the Center for Presidential History at Southern Methodist University this
fall.

> #### Potomac Networks: Waterways, Commerce, and Enslavement in the George Mason Family, 1700–1828
>
> While George Mason IV is best known as a Virginia political writer, tobacco
> planter and slaveholder, Mason IV was also an opportunistic Chesapeake
> businessman, taking advantage of an aqueous landscape bisected by the Potomac
> River. Through a focus on waterways, aquatic business ventures and local
> connections, this dissertation presents a new approach to the Mason family. In
> the eighteenth century, the Potomac River was not a divider, but rather a
> connector of people, places and enterprises along its shores. The Mason family
> built landholdings and houses, networks and businesses, on both sides of the
> river. Through digital analysis and visualizations, this dissertation argues
> that both the Mason family and the people they enslaved deployed waterways
> like the Potomac River to create opportunities and form strategic connections
> which furthered their own economic or personal goals. For the people the
> Masons enslaved, waterways often perpetuated the cycle of enslavement, but
> sometimes furnished opportunities for freedom. At a time when many of Mason
> IV’s peers were failing financially from their almost exclusive investment in
> land-based tobacco agriculture, Mason IV maintained economic stability by
> using waterways to diversify his sources of income. Ferries and fisheries,
> fueled largely by enslaved labor, became main contributors to the family’s
> eighteenth-century Potomac prosperity. In addition, the family’s success was
> bolstered by Mason IV’s skills as an expert networker. Mason IV did not
> hesitate to use the people with which he was connected as resources. He
> promoted his businesses and the family’s power and prestige through dense webs
> of relationships that stretched across the Potomac region and beyond. Mason
> IV’s networks and influence allowed him to manipulate Potomac region events
> and decisions so as to benefit the community but also himself. In short, we
> see how the Potomac River played a critical role in the lives, networks, and
> socioeconomic trajectory of the Mason family over several generations.
