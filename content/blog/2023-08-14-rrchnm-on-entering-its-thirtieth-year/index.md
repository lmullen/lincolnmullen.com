The first time that I came across the name
[Roy Rosenzweig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Rosenzweig) was in the
textbook for a class titled simply, "Historiography." The book discussed
Rosenzweig's 1983 book,
[_Eight Hours for What We Will_](https://www.cambridge.org/us/universitypress/subjects/history/american-history-general-interest/eight-hours-what-we-will-workers-and-leisure-industrial-city-18701920),
as a key work in American labor history. Since _Eight Hours_ is a history of
workers in Worcester, Massachusetts, just thirty miles from where I grew up, I
went to the library and checked out the book. As I read, I was captivated by how
Rosenzweig had captured the lives and labors of working-class people.

Sometime later I had my first encounter with the Center for History and New
Media, which was not yet named after Roy Rosenzweig. I was trying to create a
website and couldn't get it to look the way I wanted. (I am still terrible at
CSS.) I wrote to a graduate student who was working at CHNM and asked if I could
copy and paste the design for his website. He graciously said yes, introducing
me to some of the key values of CHNM: collaboration and openly sharing with all.

One of the clearest examples of openness in RRCHNM's history was the
[THATCamp](https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/gradhacker/whats-thatcamp-and-why-go-0)
movement. At a THATCamp, the schedule was decided on democratically and anyone
could propose a session. They introduced thousands and thousands of people to
the field of digital history---and the digital humanities more broadly---and
they taught people to put into action the same values that Roy Rosenzweig had
put into place at RRCHNM: openness, democracy, collaboration. While I was a grad
student, I got to attend the second "THATCamp Prime," held in Research Hall at
GMU's Fairfax campus. I still have the T-shirt, rather the worse for wear. When
I got back to Massachusetts, I was ready to organize THATCamp New England three
times.

Over its three-decade history, the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New
Media has brought compelling, democratic histories to millions and millions of
people. And the founding purpose of Roy Rosenzweig to democratize history
through new media, coupled with the founding values of openness and
collaboration, has directly shaped the careers of the scores of people who have
worked at the Center. I am lucky---and grateful---that RRCHNM has shaped my
career as well, first as a graduate student at Brandeis and for the past nine
years as affiliate faculty and one of the faculty directors at the Center. And
as I step into the role of executive director starting this academic year, I
hope that I can carry forward the same purpose and values that have defined its
past.

As RRCHNM enters its thirtieth year, its fundamental mission remains the same.
But now it has a new set of plans to accomplish that mission. Over the past
three decades, RRCHNM has reinvented itself several times, including in the past
few years under the leadership of Mills Kelly.

Here is [where we are today](https://rrchnm.org/our-work/) and where we are
headed over the next few years.

- First, RRCHNM is a leader in creating educational materials for history,
  especially K--12 education. This year, two out of every three of our millions
  of website visits will be to one of our education websites. Our educational
  resources for [world history](https://worldhistorycommons.org/) and
  [American history](https://teachinghistory.org/) are critical in a period when
  history education is contested at every turn and its value is called into
  question.

- Second, we create compelling narrative and interpretative histories for public
  audiences. This coming year our new
  [podcast studio](https://www.r2studios.org/) will release shows about the
  American Revolution and the history of American antisemitism, while continuing
  shows on women's history and the history of the Appalachian Trail. RRCHNM is
  also working on producing interactive scholarly works on subjects ranging from
  art history to early modern history.

- Third, we create data-rich histories. We know how to go from historical
  sources to data sets to rich visualizations. In many ways, these data-rich
  histories connect back to the Center's origins in social history and to its
  practice of giving people the tools to understand history for themselves.

- Finally, we train incredible digital historians. MA and PhD students in
  history who have graduated after coming through RRCHNM are educators,
  librarians, DH center staff and directors, professors, archivists,
  programmers, public historians, government officials, and a host of other
  roles. Thanks to RRCHNM, GMU's PhD program has always been one which aims
  for---and achieves---a diversity of career outcomes with a great placement
  record.

RRCHNM has a [strong team](https://rrchnm.org/our-people/) of historians,
developers, educators, podcasters, scholars, administrators, and students. The
credit for that goes to the previous executive directors, and I am grateful to
have had the chance to work for two of them. Stephen Robertson led RRCHNM to
create more interpretative histories, and he emphasized RRCHNM's distinctive
identity as a digital history center. Over the last four years, Mills Kelly has
led RRCHNM through a major transition, hiring the majority of our current team
to accomplish our new goals. He also extended RRCHNM's reach through
partnerships that we formed or continued during his tenure with institutions
such as the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and
Culture, the Luxembourg Centre for Contemporary and Digital History, and the
German Historical Institute. And as the host of
[_The Green Tunnel_](https://www.r2studios.org/show/the-green-tunnel/), he led
that podcast to over 100,000 downloads and an enthusiastic following among
historians and hikers.

I am grateful to have worked at RRCHNM for the past nine years, and I hope to be
a careful steward of the Center as I step into this new role. I'd invite you to
browse our [list of staff](https://rrchnm.org/our-people/) and read some of
their bios. You'll quickly get a sense of what I've felt daily over the past few
years: that this group of historians is doing important work democratizing
access to history with an open, collaborative spirit, just as Roy Rosenzweig
founded CHNM to do.
