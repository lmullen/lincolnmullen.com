# Course description

The relationship between religion and capitalism has long occupied historians of the United States, and before them it concerned the people whom historians study. In this class, you will meet many people whose religion led them to interact with capitalism in unexpected and unusual ways. You will meet the Puritans whose work ethic supposedly created capitalism, but who insisted on resting on the Sabbath; Moravian missionaries who made converts and money; slaves, slaveowners, and abolitionists who all claimed the Bible when reckoning with the capitalist system of slavery; a Protestant writer who insisted that Jesus was a businessman, and Catholics who believed Jesus called them to a kind of socialism; African American preachers who marketed their recorded sermons; Jews who mass-manufactured matzah and created Yiddish socialism; an industrialist who wrote The Gospel of Wealth, and laborers who created churches for the working class; nineteenth-century consumers who turned gift-giving into a ritual, and twenty-first-century television personalities who turned consumption into therapy; Christians whose faith turned them into environmentalists, and Christians who drilled for crude oil; converts who thought religion required poverty, and Prosperity Gospelers who thought it promised wealth. You will read primary sources from American history, secondary works in American religious history, and excerpts from theorists of religion and capitalism. Through these readings and your own writing, you are invited to make sense of this perpetual historical puzzle.

# Essential information

You are always welcome to talk with me during office hours via Zoom. My [office hours page](/page/office-hours/) has instructions on how to book an appointment.

All communication for this course will happen in [our Slack group](https://mason-dh-grad.slack.com/signup). Please sign up and join the `#capitalism-2020` channel. Read this [getting started guide](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/218080037-Getting-started-for-new-users) if you need help.

Each week the syllabus features a main, book-length reading, and an article- or chapter-length reading for comparison. All of the main readings listed on the schedule are available for purchase in the university bookstore and elsewhere. Feel free to buy or borrow as you like: just be sure you have a copy you can read in full. The comparison readings are available through the university library, in PDF, or online, though in a few instances I have suggested editions that would be worth purchasing.

# Assignments

All written assignments should be submitted to the course Blackboard site as a PDF. You should also circulate your book reviews and primary sources via Slack so that other people in the class can read them. Book reviews and primary sources must be circulated by Thursday night before the relevant class meeting. Standard rules for historical papers: 11- or 12-point serif font; 1-inch margins; follow the *Chicago Manual of Style* religiously. Final grades will be calculated using the typical percentage-based grading scale (A = 93--100, A- = 90--92, B+ = 88--89, B = 83--87, B- = 80--82, ... F = 0--59).

**Pre-circulated discussion questions (5%) and participation (5%).** Preparation and participation are expected as a matter of course in a graduate class. Complete all readings before class and submit all assignments by the due date. The better you prepare, the better our class discussions will be. Each week you will post three substantive questions or points of discussion to the Slack group. You can raise points about the works under discussion, the relationship between them, or the relationship to anything we've read previously. These should be posted by 1:00pm on Monday before class. During the weeks you present a book review or lead the primary source discussion, you do not have to submit questions.

**Leading discussion of primary sources (10%).** Beginning with week three, you will sign up for one week in which you will identify primary sources related to the topic, circulate them among the group, and lead a discussion of them. I will help you identify good sources; just plan ahead in advance if you want help with that. Often these sources could be ones that were explicitly discussed in the main readings for that week.

**Book reviews (2 x 20%) and leading class discussion.** For each week on the syllabus, there will be suggested additional books on the subject. Over the course of the semester, you will write two reviews of books related to that week's discussion. You may select any book from the additional readings or, with permission, any other book on the history of capitalism and American religion, or the history of capitalism more generally. The reviews should be analyses, not summaries. *Reviews in American History* is a better model than *JAH* or *AHR* book reviews. Explain the overall argument of the book, whether it is effective, what are its source base and theoretical framework, and how it fits into the literature we have been reading. These reviews are stepping stones to your final essay, as well as important contributions towards broadening the base of knowledge for the class. The same week your review is due, you will give a presentation about and lead a brief discussion of your chosen books on the weeks you signed up for.

**Essay on religion and capitalism (40%).** You will write a fifteen-page historiographical essay on a topic of your choice related to religion and capitalism. This essay should be based on five or six books, at least three of which you should have read specifically for this assignment. You will turn in a few sentences about your topic as well as a list of books for approval in advance. You will also submit a complete rough draft (emphasis on *complete*) for comment, which will be worth 5% of your course grade. The final paper will be worth the other 35%.

- Topic statement and book list due on October 14.
- Rough draft due on December 1.
- Final paper due on December 10.
