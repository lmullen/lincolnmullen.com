## Course description

The relationship between religion and capitalism has long occupied historians of the United States, and before them it concerned the people whom historians study. In this class, you will meet many people whose religion led them to interact with capitalism in unexpected and unusual ways. You will meet the Puritans whose work ethic supposedly created capitalism, but who insisted on resting on the Sabbath; Moravian missionaries who made converts and money; slaves, slaveowners, and abolitionists who all claimed the Bible when reckoning with the capitalist system of slavery; a Protestant writer who insisted that Jesus was a businessman, and Catholics who believed Jesus called them to a kind of socialism; African American preachers who marketed their recorded sermons; Jews who mass-manufactured matzah and created Yiddish socialism; an industrialist who wrote _The Gospel of Wealth_, and laborers who created churches for the working class; nineteenth-century consumers who turned gift-giving into a ritual, and twenty-first-century television personalities who turned consumption into therapy; Christians whose faith turned them into environmentalists, and Christians who drilled for crude oil; converts who thought religion required poverty, and Prosperity Gospelers who thought it promised wealth. You will read primary sources from American history, secondary works in American religious history, and excerpts from theorists of religion and capitalism. Through these readings and your own writing, you are invited to make sense of this perpetual historical puzzle.

## Essential information

You are always welcome to talk with me during office hours. My [office hours page](/page/office-hours/) has instructions on how to book an appointment.

Each week the syllabus features a main, book-length reading, and an article- or chapter-length reading for comparison. You are responsible for obtaining a copy of book-length readings for yourself. The comparison readings are available through the university library, in PDF on the course Blackboard site, or online.

Early in the semester you will be subscribed to our class listserv. Please use that any time you need to circulate information to everyone in the course.

## Assignments

All written assignments should be brought to class in paper copy before the session starts. For record keeping, please also upload them to the course Blackboard. I will record grades in Blackboard, but provide any written comments on your paper copy. Because most of the assignments are intended to contribute to our class discussion, late work cannot accomplish that intended purpose and will not be accepted.

Please also circulate the documents and discussion questions via the course listserv to the everyone in the course. Book reviews and primary sources must be circulated by Friday night before the relevant class meeting. Discussion questions should be circulated by 5:00pm on the day of the class meeting.

Standard rules for historical papers: 11- or 12-point serif font; 1-inch margins; double-spaced; follow the _Chicago Manual of Style_ religiously. Final grades will be calculated using the typical percentage-based grading scale (A = 93--100, A- = 90--92, B+ = 88--89, B = 83--87, B- = 80--82, ... F = 0--59).

**Pre-circulated discussion questions (5%) and participation (5%).** Preparation and participation are expected as a matter of course in a graduate class. Complete all readings before class and submit all assignments by the due date. Each week you should post at least one substantive question or point of discussion to the listserv. You can raise points about the works under discussion, the relationship between them, or their relationship to anything we've read previously.

**Leading discussion of primary sources (10%).** Beginning with week two, you will sign up for one week in which you will identify primary sources related to the topic, circulate them among the group, and lead a discussion of them. I will help you identify good sources; just plan ahead in advance if you want help with that. Often these sources could be ones that were explicitly discussed in the main readings for that week.

**Book reviews (2 x 20%) and leading class discussion.** For each week on the syllabus, there will be suggested additional books on the subject. Over the course of the semester, you will write two reviews of books related to that week's discussion. You may select any book from the additional readings or, with permission, any other book on the history of capitalism and American religion or the history of capitalism more generally. The reviews should be analyses, not summaries. _Reviews in American History_ is a better model than _JAH_ or _AHR_ book reviews. Explain the overall argument of the book, whether it is effective, what sources it uses and what theoretical framework it operates withing, and how it fits into the literature we have been reading. These reviews are stepping stones to your final essay, as well as important contributions towards broadening the base of knowledge for the class. The same week your review is due, you will give a presentation about and lead a discussion of your chosen books. Reviews should be about 750 to 1000 words. Your portion of the class discussion should be about 15 minutes, with a maximum of about 20 minutes.

**Essay on American religion and capitalism (40%).** You will write an essay of 12 to 15 pages on the topic of your choice related to religion and capitalism. You must write to a genre, but you are free to select the genre in consultation with me. Some possible options: (a) a historiography paper; (b) an analysis of primary sources; (c) a podcast script; (d) a narrative; (e) a magazine article; (f) a museum exhibit. The form of the essay will be determined by the genre you select. But whatever you write, you must make clear the connection to the course content. We can clarify this assignment as necessary at the midpoint of the semester.

You will submit a proposal, which will be graded on a completion basis. You will also submit a complete rough draft (emphasis on _complete_) for comment, which will be worth 5% of your course grade. The final paper will be worth the other 35%.

- Topic paragraph and book list due on October 16.
- Rough draft due on November 27.
- Final paper due on December 10.

## Fine print

This syllabus may be updated online as necessary. The online version of this syllabus is the only authoritative version.

You are expected to attend each class and to participate actively (exceptions made only for health reasons, religious holidays, and other university-approved excuses). Participation grades may be reduced due to repeated absences. If you wish to be excused for an absence, please email me before the absence if possible, or as soon as possible after the absence.

Late work will not be accepted for any reason. If there are unusual circumstances beyond your control, I may permit you to reschedule an assignment for another week, but you must notify me in advance if at all possible. I will agree to an incomplete grade for this course only under the rarest of circumstances. I will discuss grades only during office hours.

Students must check (and respond as necessary) to communications sent via email.

If the campus closes, or if a class meeting needs to be canceled or adjusted due to weather or some other concern, students should check their email for updates on how to continue learning and for information about any changes assignments.

Unless otherwise specified, you should work on your own for assignments. In general, every source that you use should be acknowledged in a note or bibliography entry. Sources must be adequately paraphrased, meaning (at a minimum) that word choice, sentence and paragraph structure, and the order of ideas must be made your own. Whenever you use others’ exact words, you must mark them as such by quotation marks or block quotations with accompanying citations. Plagiarism consists of presenting the writing, research, or analysis of others as one’s own. It applies not only to using the text of another author’s work verbatim without quotation marks and accurate citations but also to the taking of specific information, analysis or opinions---even if not in the exact words of the author---and presenting them without citation in one’s own paper. Using AI-assistance for any paper is also plagiarism (at least for now). Any instance of plagiarism will result in, at minimum, the student receiving a grade of 0 on the assignment, and the student will not be given the opportunity to rewrite the paper.
