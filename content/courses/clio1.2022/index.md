## Course description

## Learning goals

## Essential information

Class as collaboration

Most required readings are available online or through the GMU libraries. These are the main books that we will be using.

-   TBD

All communication for this course will happen in [our Slack group](https://mason-dh-grad.slack.com/signup). Read this [getting started guide](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/218080037-Getting-started-for-new-users) if you need help. The Slack group is your primary place to ask for help. Please ask for help in the public channels rather than private messages. You are almost certainly not the only person to have your question, and asking and answering questions publicly benefits everyone. When you ask a question, help me help you by including the code that you are asking about and any error messages that are relevant.

You are always welcome to talk with me during office hours. My [office hours page](/page/office-hours/) has instructions on how to book an appointment and connect to a Webex session. If the scheduled times don't work for you, please contact me and suggest a few other times that would work for you.

Bring a computer to each class meeting. 

## Assignments

For each assignment, you should send me the completed HTML file knit from your RMarkdown document. Please submit the assignments via the Blackboard page for this class. Send the assignments before the start of class on the day on which they are due.

Preparation and participation are expected as a matter of course in a graduate class. Complete all readings and submit all assignments before class. If the readings include sample code or questions at the end, work through them as part of doing the readings, though you do not need to to submit them and I will not check them. Final grades will be calculated using the typical percentage-based grading scale (A = 93--100, A- = 90--92, B+ = 88--89, B = 83--87, B- = 80--82, ... F = 0--59).

**Worksheets and weekly assignments (25%).**

This syllabus may be updated online as necessary. The online version of this syllabus is the only authoritative version.

Students must satisfactorily complete all assignments in order to pass this course. I am sometimes willing to grant extensions on assignments for cause, but you must request an extension before the assignment's due date. For every day or part of a day that an assignment is late without an extension, I may reduce your grade. No work (other than final projects) will be accepted after the last day that the class meets. I will discuss grades only in person during office hours.
