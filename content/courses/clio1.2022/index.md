## Course description

This class is an introduction to the practice and theory of digital history---but above all the practice. I take it for granted that you already developed a scholarly interest in the history of particular places, periods, and topics, and that you have already received (or are about to receive) an education in the research practices of conventional history.

This class will focus on what is distinctive about digital history. Those distinctions include the following: the form of scholarship is digital rather than print or derived from print; the methods of scholarship may be digital rather than conventional; the work is usually collaborative; often the audience is conceived of as public rather than academic in some way; and the work might take place in a research center, library, or museum rather than an academic department. This list is imperfect, not least because it overstates the difference between conventional and digital history, and finding those continuities will be among the most important questions for this course. Nevertheless it will shape many of the topics we will pursue and how we will work together as a class.

As an introduction, this class aims to prepare you for further study and research in several ways. You will gain the basic technical capabilities and confidence to attempt your own DH projects, including possibly a digital dissertation. The most important of those capabilities will be a familiarity with the technologies of the web---the Gutenberg Revolution of digital scholarship. The course also aims to give you experience working as a team of scholars on collaborative projects. It will prepare you to take the other graduate-level courses offered in digital history at George Mason. As a decidedly secondary goal, it will introduce you to the discourse around digital history/humanities as a field, which you could pursue further as a minor field or in a readings course. Above all, this class aims to turn you into a working digital historian.

## Learning goals

After taking this class, students will

1. have a familiarity with the main areas of digital history research as a field of practice, and be able to undertake basic research in many of them;
2. be able to read and comprehend digital scholarly projects in the same way that they would a book or journal article;
3. have a basic competence with web technologies as a foundation for their own scholarly practices;
4. have gained experience working collaboratively to conceive, plan, create, and disseminate scholarly projects; and
5. have the foundational knowledge to advance in the DH curriculum at GMU.

## Essential information

The structure of this class is intended to model what it is intended to teach, namely collaborative historical work. You may find that the class differs in two ways from other graduate-level classes you have taken, in that it requires collaboration for the main assignments in the class, and that how we spend large parts of our class time will be determined collaboratively. We will figure out how to create a collaborative learning community together over the course of the semester.

I care about your success in this course and more generally as a graduate student.

Most required readings are available online or through the GMU libraries. These are the main books that we will be using for which you need to acquire your own copy.

- TBD

Communication for this course will happen in [our Slack group](https://mason-dh-grad.slack.com/signup); you can sign up at that link. Read this [getting started guide](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/218080037-Getting-started-for-new-users) if you need help. The Slack group is a place for you to communicate with other people in the class, as well as to ask for help. Please ask for help in the public channels rather than private messages. You are almost certainly not the only person to have your question, and asking and answering questions publicly benefits everyone.

You are always welcome to talk with me during office hours. My [office hours page](/page/office-hours/) has instructions on how to book an appointment. If the scheduled times don't work for you, please contact me and suggest a few other times that would work for you.

Please bring a computer to each class meeting. Almost any computer should work for what we are going to do. My own experience is with Unix-like operating systems, like Ubuntu and MacOS, but I will endeavor to help you get alternatives should you be working on Windows.

## Assignments

Please submit each assignment to Blackboard. (Yes, I know using Blackboard is a violation of other stated principles for this course, but without it I am hopeless at keeping track of assignments and grades.) Send the assignments before the start of class on the day on which they are due.

Preparation and participation are expected as a matter of course in a graduate class. Complete all readings and any assignments we will be discussing in class before our session begins, and be prepared to actively discuss the topics at hand. That said, I am not a stickler for deadlines in graduate classes and do not assign late penalties, but please do not use this leeway to hinder other people in the class or to get yourself into an irretrievable situation. Likewise, if my grade for your assignment is unsatisfactory, you may revise it for additional credit. That said, no assignments (except final projects) may be submitted beyond the last day of class, and there are no extensions for final projects.

Final grades will be calculated using the typical percentage-based grading scale (A = 93--100, A- = 90--92, B+ = 88--89, B = 83--87, B- = 80--82, ... F = 0--59).

## Fine print

This syllabus may be updated online as necessary. The online version of this syllabus is the only authoritative version.

GMU has many resources available for graduate students; please [see the list on the department website](https://historyarthistory.gmu.edu/graduate/mason-resources-for-graduate-students).

Students must satisfactorily complete all assignments in order to pass this course. No work (other than final projects) will be accepted after the last day that the class meets. I will discuss grades only in person during office hours.

Much of our course work will appear online, as is the norm in this field. That said, not everyone's circumstances make being online safe for them. If this is a potential problem for you, please discuss it privately with me and we will find a solution such as anonymity or an alternative assignment that works for you.

GMU has established well-defined [COVID-19 policies](https://www.gmu.edu/safe-return-campus) about masking, testing, and the like. We will follow the relevant university guidance and, if necessary, adapt. If you have individual concerns that you would like to express to me privately, you are more than welcome to do so.

While much of our class communication will be in Slack, please do check your Mason email, since critical communications from me or from the university may be sent there.

See the [George Mason University catalog](https://catalog.gmu.edu/) for general policies, as well as the university [statement on diversity](https://ctfe.gmu.edu/professional-development/mason-diversity-statement/). You are expected to know and follow George Mason's policies on [academic integrity](https://oai.gmu.edu/) and the [honor code](https://oai.gmu.edu/mason-honor-code/). If you are a student with a disability and you need academic accommodations, please contact the Office of Disability Services at 703-993-2474 or through [their website](https://ods.gmu.edu), then provide their documented accomodations to me. You are responsible for verifying your enrollment status. Please note the dates for dropping and adding courses from the [GMU academic calendar](https://registrar.gmu.edu/calendars/).
