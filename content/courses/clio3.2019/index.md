# Course description

Students in this course will work collaboratively to create a web application with historical applications from scratch. Working with the instructor, students will decide early in the semester what the scope and purpose of the web application should be, including its historical content. By working on a web application, students will learn three fundamental technologies: how to create a data model and administer a relational database; how to create an application layer using a web application framework; and how to create a user interface for the web. While the exact languages to be used will be determined by the needs of the project, most likely we will use PostgreSQL as the database, the Django web framework for the Python programming language for the application, and (of course) JavaScript and other web standards for the user interface. Students will thus become familiar with those languages and frameworks, as well as with the tools and techniques of collaborative software development. But even more important, students will learn to conceptualize, manage, and design a project that makes a meaningful contribution to the field of digital history.
