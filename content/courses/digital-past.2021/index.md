# Course description

In this class, you will to learn to do history using digital tools. The course---which satisfies the [Mason Core IT requirement](http://masoncore.gmu.edu/general-education-at-mason-2/information-technology-1/)---teaches the fundamentals of information technology by applying them to practical problems in history. Throughout the semester, you will work individually and with classmates on a series of projects about American history during the period of Reconstruction. You will learn how to do research online, but also how to put those sources in the context of other scholarly work. You will gather data, learn how to question it, analyze it, summarize it, and interpret it. You will create visualizations of datasets, including maps. You will learn how to present visual and textual sources online in web exhibits, and you will learn how to write and publish effectively online. Through learning by doing, you will gain both digital skills and the skills of a historian. This combination will be useful to you throughout your university career and in your future work. The topics we are learning---digital literacy, and the complex of issues around race, politics, and economics tied to the history of Reconstruction---are now more than ever vital to understanding and participating in American democracy.

# Learning goals

In this course you will

-   learn the history of American Reconstruction, 
-   create historical scholarship using digital tools and resources, 
-   publish historical scholarship on the web, and
-   develop your digital literacies.

You will also learn the [IT competencies](http://masoncore.gmu.edu/general-education-at-mason-2/information-technology-1/) from the Mason Core:

1.  Students will understand the principles of information storage, exchange, security, and privacy and be aware of related ethical issues.
2.  Students will become critical consumers of digital information; they will be capable of selecting and evaluating appropriate, relevant, and trustworthy sources of information.
3.  Students can use appropriate information and computing technologies to organize and analyze information and use it to guide decision-making.
4.  Students will be able to choose and apply appropriate algorithmic methods to solve a problem.

# Essential information

For spring semester 2021, this class will be taught online. Of course, given ongoing developments of the pandemic and the possibility of COVID-19 exposure, we will all have to remain flexible. In addition to following all GMU policies about COVID-19, I ask that you communicate with me if you will be absent from class or if you will turn in an assignment late. Likewise, please check for emails and other messages from me in case there are ever any developments that affect our class. By working together, we will make this a semester where you stay safe and learn a great deal about information technology and the history of Reconstruction.

The Zoom connection information is available on Blackboard.

This class will include a combination of lecture, discussion, and in-class and out-of-class assignments. Doing the reading is absolutely essential. Attend class having read any assigned material and completed any out-of-class assignments, and be prepared to discuss both. You must have a copy of the texts assigned for each day available to you during class (electronic copies are fine, of course).

To facilitate our class, communication for this course will happen in [our Slack group](https://mason-dh-grad.slack.com/signup). Please sign up and join the `#digital-past-2021` channel. Read this [getting started guide](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/218080037-Getting-started-for-new-users) if you need help.

Before the start of class each week, I will send you a message about what to expect. This will help guide your participation in class each week. Please read it carefully and note any actions you should take.

You are always welcome to talk with me during office hours. To do so, please [book an appointment](/page/office-hours/). If the scheduled times don't work for you, [email me](mailto:lmullen@gmu.edu) and suggest a few other times that would work for you. 

**Required readings.** Only one book is required. All other readings will be available on Blackboard or through the GMU libraries.

-   Foner, Eric. *A Short History of Reconstruction*. Updated edition. Harper Collins, 2015. ISBN: 978-0062370860.

You will also need to sign up for a year's hosting with [Reclaim Hosting](https://reclaimhosting.com/shared-hosting/). Do the cheapest option, the "Personal Plan." We will go over this in class, and you do not need to set this up until I explain it.

# Assignments

Grades will be based on the following assignments. Final grades will be calculated using the typical percentage-based grading scale (A = 93--100, A- = 90--92, B+ = 88--89, B = 83--87, B- = 80--82, ... F = 0--59).

Turn in all assignments on Blackboard. In the box for the assignment text, include the URL to your assignment or blog post. This URL must be public. You should test the URL with a browser that is not logged in.

In this class you will create a number of smaller projects on the history of Reconstruction. Each of these projects will demonstrate a specific skill that you learned in class. These assignments are deliberately smaller scale and build on one another so that you can develop your digital literacy over time, rather than being obligated to one or two high stakes assignments. You will also write blog posts on various subjects. 

**Blog posts and skills assignments (12 @ 5% each = 60%).** Each Thursday you will be assigned either to write a blog post or to undertake a skills-based digital assignment. **All assignments or blog posts given on Thursday are due before the start of class on Tuesday.** Except for the Omeka assignments, embed these in a page or post on your WordPress website. If asked to write a blog post, it should be approximately three hundred words long, using full sentences, paragraphs with topic sentences, and images or other illustrations as appropriate. 

**Quizzes (10%).** Any class may (and likely will) include a brief quiz over the assigned readings.

**Midterm exam (10%).** There will be a mid-term examination covering both the historical and the information technology aspects of this class.

**Final exam (10%).** There will be a final examination covering both the historical and the information technology aspects of this class.

**Participation (10%).** In addition to participating in class discussions, specific opportunities for participating in class (in person or online) will be explained prior to class sessions. These will sometimes include smaller group discussions through breakout rooms in Slack and Zoom.

# Fine print

This syllabus may be updated online as necessary. The online version of this syllabus is the only authoritative version.

Follow the GMU [COVID-19 safety protocols](https://www2.gmu.edu/safe-return-campus) at all times.

You are expected to attend each class and to participate actively (exceptions made only for health reasons, religious holidays, and other university-approved excuses). Whether or not students attend class consistently is the best indicator of how well they will do in the class.

Computers, phones, and the like are to be used only for course work while class is in session. Grades may be reduced due to repeated absences. Complete all the readings before the start of each class. No unexcused late work will be accepted. No work will be accepted after the last day of class unless specifically assigned. I will discuss grades only in conversation during office hours, not over email.

Class communications will be sent to your GMU email account, which you must check. You should also check the course Slack group regularly, and be logged into it during class if you are not in the classroom in-person.

Unless otherwise specified, you should work on your own for assignments. In general, every source that you use should be acknowledged in a note or bibliography entry. Sources must be adequately paraphrased, meaning (at a minimum) that word choice, sentence and paragraph structure, and the order of ideas must be made your own. Whenever you use others' exact words, you must mark them as such by quotation marks or block quotations with accompanying citations. Plagiarism consists of presenting the writing, research, or analysis of others as one's own. It applies not only to using the text of another author's work verbatim without quotation marks and accurate citations but also to the taking of specific information, analysis or opinions---even if not in the exact words of the author---and presenting them without citation in one's own paper. Any instance of plagiarism will result in, at minimum, the student receiving a grade of 0 on this paper, and the student will not be given the opportunity to rewrite the paper.

George Mason University has an [Honor Code](https://oai.gmu.edu/mason-honor-code/), which requires all members of this community to maintain the highest standards of academic honesty and integrity. Cheating, plagiarism, lying, and stealing are all prohibited. All violations of the Honor Code will be reported to the Honor Committee.

See the George Mason University [catalog](http://catalog.gmu.edu/) for general policies, as well as the university [statement on diversity](http://ctfe.gmu.edu/professional-development/mason-diversity-statement/). 

If you are a student with a disability and you need academic accommodations, please see me and contact the [Office of Disability Resources](https://ds.gmu.edu/) at 703-993-2474. All academic accommodations must be arranged through that office.

Students are responsible for verifying their enrollment in this class. Schedule adjustments should be made by the deadlines published in the Schedule of Classes. (Deadlines each semester are published in the Schedule of Classes available from the [Registrar's website](https://registrar.gmu.edu/).)

HIST 390 is taught by many people at George Mason, and I have borrowed assignments, readings, and the structure of the course from syllabi by Erin Bush, Dan Cohen, Amanda French, Mills Kelly, Sharon Leon, Mike O'Malley, Abby Mullen, and Stephen Robertson.
