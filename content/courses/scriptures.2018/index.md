# Course description

In this course, students will analyze texts that Americans have treated as "scripture." Students will read texts that present themselves as scripture, such as selections from the Book of Mormon and a Holy Sacred and Divine Roll and Book (a Shaker text). They will also read texts that have attained a sort of canonicity within American culture, such as the Declaration of Independence and Martin Luther King Jr.'s "Letter from Birmingham Jail." Students will thus gain more than a valuable familiarity with a variety of American religious traditions. They will also reflect on the way that, even in a digital age, texts continue to shape American identity. Finally, the course invites students to reflect on the meaning and function of "scripture." Although many Americans reflexively define scripture as "the Word of God" or think of the Bible or the Qu’ran, the scholar Wilfred Cantwell Smith cautions that "no text is a scripture in itself and as such. People---a given community---make a text into scripture, or keep it scripture." Along those lines, Americans, and different groups of Americans, have granted such authority to a wide variety of texts. 

# Learning goals

In this course you will 

- gain familiarity with a variety of American religious traditions, including Shakerism, Mormonism, Christian Science, Adventism, Judaism, Christianity, and the Nation of Islam.
- develop your ability to carefully analyze texts, paying attention to issues such as authorship, intertextuality, and reception. 
- articulate historical insights clearly and memorably in prose, through an online exhibit, and in a museum exhibit.

# Essential information

You are always welcome to visit me during my office hours. While you can drop in, I strongly recommend that you [book an appointment with this link](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/selfsched?sstoken=UU94MzdPM1ZlU0ZqfGRlZmF1bHR8ZTg3NzRjZDZiYTMxNDU5ZjEzNjZkZTZkODAyODVmYWI). If the scheduled times don't work for you, [email me](mailto:lmullen@gmu.edu) and we will find another time. Whether you need help in the class or just want to talk more about it, get in touch sooner rather than later. 

The following textbooks are required and are available through the bookstore and elsewhere:

- Maffley-Kipp, Laurie F. *American Scriptures: An Anthology of Sacred Writings*. Penguin, 2010. ISBN: 978-0-14-310619-7.
- Prothero, Stephen. *The American Bible: How Our Words United, Divide, and Define a Nation*. HarperOne, 2012. ISBN: 978-0-06-212345-9.

Other readings will be available online, on Blackboard, or through the GMU libraries. It wouldn't hurt to get a copy of the Christian or Hebrew Bible---any translation or edition will do.

## On studying religion in the classroom

A few words of advice from a historian of American religion (modified from [Tona Hangen](http://www.tonahangen.com/)):

1. Religious rituals, acts, beliefs, and doctrines make sense in context. If something doesn't make sense to you, then you need more context. Don't think "how could they believe that?" Instead seek understanding: "Why was this believable to them? What work did this belief or ritual accomplish?" At least in the classroom, no religious concept should be dismissed as weird,crazy, or abnormal. There is no "normal." You can certainly have your own opinions and personal beliefs about religion, but those don't belong in our classroom discussion.

2. As much as is possible, approach your scholarship as a historian, rather than as a believer or a skeptic. While religious doctrines will be discussed, it is never with the intent to prove a religion right or wrong. Please do not use our class as a platform for either proselytizing your faith to convert others, or debunking the faith of others to lessen their commitment. Our class is going to be made up of a variety of faiths and degrees of religious involvement which we should all respect.

3. History provides an opportunity to expand our ability to empathize with those not like ourselves. In fact, the past (and present, for that matter) is a very strange place, populated with people who do not share many of your values and ideas about the world. Developing the ability to at least understand why those values and ideas may be compelling is a great skill for surviving and thriving in a diverse world.

# Assignments 

This class will have two essential activities. The first is reading texts and then discussing them and writing about them. Most days we will read primary source texts which have been regarded as scripture by one group or another. While I will give lectures to set the context, much of our class time will be spent discussing these texts. You will also be asked to write several short analytical essays about these texts. I will often bring additional sources to class for us to read together in class.

The second main activity for this class will be creating a [popup museum](http://popupmuseum.org/) and accompanying online exhibit about scriptures in America. Beginning after the first few weeks of the semester, we will work together as a class to define a theme for our museum. Then we will find texts, create facsimiles of artifacts, and write explanatory text. We will publish our exhibit online. To prepare for this assignment, you will visit the Museum of the Bible in Washington, DC, and to study it critically as a "text."

**Reading quizzes and class participation (15 points):** On any given class I may give a brief quiz over the assigned reading, which will pose no difficulty if you have read thoroughly. I will also give you a few participation assignments to prompt class discussion (some of these are listed on the syllabus already). Participation in class discussions is vital. I will assign a grade for this section at the end of the semester.

**Short response papers (4 papers × 10 points/paper = 40 points):** You will be asked to write four very short papers responding to some texts that we have read. There are six possible papers throughout the semester; the prompts and requirements are listed in the schedule below. You must write the one about the Museum of the Bible, but you can pick which of the other three you want to write. These are due at the start of class.

**Museum assignment (45 total points)**: Our main work for the course will be creating the popup museum. Parts of this work will be due throughout the semester. Your grade for this assignment will be determined by the text you edit or facsimile artifacts you create (15 points), the exhibit text that you write (15 points), the bibliography you compile (5 points), and your contributions to the larger class exhibit (10 points). You will receive full instructions and due dates for this assignment later in the semester, as we develop our ideas for what the exhibit should be about.

**[Guidelines for the museum assignment](American Scriptures exhibit assignment - fall 2018.pdf)**

Final grades will be calculated using the typical percentage-based grading scale (A = 93--100, A- = 90--92, B+ = 88--89, B = 83--87, B- = 80--82, ... F = 0--59).

No work will be accepted after the last day of class unless specifically assigned. I will discuss grades only in person during office hours.

Unless otherwise specified, you should work on your own for assignments. If you do receive help or cooperate on an assignment, all such work should be acknowledged explicitly. In general, every source that you use should be acknowledged in a note or bibliography entry. Sources must be adequately paraphrased, meaning (at a minimum) that word choice, sentence and paragraph structure, and the order of ideas must be made your own. Whenever you use others’ exact words, you must mark them as such by quotation marks or block quotations with accompanying citations.

Undergraduate students may choose to exercise a selective withdrawal. See the Schedule of Classes for selective withdrawal procedures.

"Render therefore to all their dues": My colleague John Turner put together an early draft of this syllabus. The idea for a popup museum of religion came from [Richard Newton](https://twitter.com/seedpods/status/952178995583488001).
