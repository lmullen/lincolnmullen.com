## Course description

In this course, students will analyze texts that Americans have treated as “scripture.” Students will read texts that present themselves as scripture, such as selections from the Book of Mormon and a Holy Sacred and Divine Roll and Book (a Shaker text). They will also read texts that have attained a sort of canonicity within American culture, such as the Declaration of Independence and Martin Luther King Jr.’s “Letter from Birmingham Jail.” Students will thus gain more than a valuable familiarity with a variety of American religious traditions. They will also reflect on the way that, even in a digital age, texts continue to shape American identity. Finally, the course invites students to reflect on the meaning and function of “scripture.” Although many Americans reflexively define scripture as “the Word of God” or think of the Bible or the Qur’an, the scholar Wilfred Cantwell Smith cautions that “no text is a scripture in itself and as such. People—a given community—make a text into scripture, or keep it scripture.” Along those lines, Americans, and different groups of Americans, have granted such authority to a wide variety of texts.

## Learning goals

In this course you will

- gain familiarity with a variety of American religious traditions, including Shakerism, Mormonism, Christian Science, Adventism, Judaism, and the Nation of Islam.
- develop your ability to carefully analyze texts, paying attention to issues such as authorship, intertextuality, and reception.
- articulate historical insights clearly and memorably in prose.

This class fulfills the Mason Core Literature requirement. The readings and assignments are designed to fulfill these learning goals. Students will be able to

- read for comprehension, detail, and nuance.
- identify the specific literary qualities of language as employed in the texts they read.
- analyze the ways specific literary devices contribute to the meaning of a text.
- identify and evaluate the contribution of the social, political, historical, and cultural contexts in which a literary text is produced.
- evaluate a critical argument in others' writing as well as their own.

## Essential information

This class will include a combination of lecture, discussion, and active learning. Doing the reading is absolutely essential. There will be a reading quiz every class period: if you've done the reading, you can expect to do well on the quizzes. Attend class having read any assigned material and be prepared to discuss or otherwise engage with those readings in class. You must have a copy of the texts assigned for each day available to you during class (electronic copies are fine).

You are always welcome to talk with me during office hours. To do so, please [book an appointment](/page/office-hours/). If the scheduled times don't work for you, [email me](mailto:lmullen@gmu.edu) and suggest a few other times that would work for you. I try to come to class early and stay briefly after class for short conversations.

You are likewise welcome to email me at any time: <lmullen@gmu.edu>. You can generally expect a response within 48 hours, though never on the weekend.

**Required readings.** The following books are required. Any edition will do.

- Maffly-Kipp, Laurie F. _American Scriptures: An Anthology of Sacred Writings_. Penguin, 2010. ISBN: 978-0-14-310619-7.
- Prothero, Stephen. _The American Bible: How Our Words United, Divide, and Define a Nation_. HarperOne, 2012. ISBN: 978-0-06-212345-9.
- Rothschild, Mike. _The Storm Is Upon Us: How QAnon Became a Movement, Cult, and Conspiracy Theory of Everything_. Melville House, 2022. ISBN: 978-1685890186.

Other readings will be available on Blackboard or through the GMU libraries. It wouldn’t hurt to get a copy of the Christian Bible---any translation or edition will do, and there are versions available for free online.

## Assignments

This class will have two essential activities. The first is reading texts and then discussing them and writing about them. Most days we will read primary source texts which have been regarded as scripture by one group or another. While I will give lectures to set the context, much of our class time will be spent discussing these texts. You will also be asked to write several short analytical essays about these texts. I may bring additional sources to class for us to read together in class.

The second main activity for this class will be creating a collaborative explanation of the Qanon conspiracy theory and the the "Q drops" as a new American scripture. The purpose of this capstone assignment is to collaboratively understand a recent and contested phenomenon in American life in terms of what we have learned in this course about how communities and texts co-constitute one another. Details about this assignment will be provided separately by the mid-point of the semester.

**Reading quizzes and class participation (20 points):** Every class will have a brief quiz over the assigned reading, which will pose no difficulty if you have read thoroughly. I will also give you a few participation assignments to prompt class discussion (some of these are listed on the syllabus already). Participation in class discussions is vital. I will assign a grade for this section at the end of the semester.

**Short response papers (4 papers × 10 points/paper = 40 points):** You will be asked to write four very short papers responding to some texts that we have read. There are six possible papers throughout the semester; the prompts and requirements are listed in the schedule below. These are due at the start of class; no exceptions or extensions. These must be submitted in Blackboard.

**Museum assignment (40 total points)**: Our main work for the course will be creating the popup museum. Parts of this work will be due throughout the semester. Your grade for this assignment will be determined by the text you edit or facsimile artifacts you create (15 points), the exhibit text that you write (15 points), the bibliography you compile (5 points), and your contributions to the larger class exhibit (10 points). You will receive full instructions and due dates for this assignment later in the semester, as we develop our ideas for what the exhibit should be about.

Final grades will be calculated using this scale: A = 93--100, A- = 90--92, B+ = 88--89, B = 83--87, B- = 80--82, ... F = 0--59.

## Schedule

## Fine print

This syllabus may be updated online as necessary. The online version of this syllabus is the only authoritative version.

Please submit all assignments in Blackboard, unless I collect them on paper in class.

You are expected to attend each class and to participate actively (exceptions made only for health reasons, religious holidays, and other university-approved excuses). Whether or not students attend class consistently is the best indicator of how well they will do in the class. Participation grades may be reduced due to repeated absences. If you wish to be excused for an absence, please email me before the absence if possible, or as soon as possible after the absence. I understand that life happens, and I will do my best to work with you.

Computers, phones, and the like are to be used only for course work while class is in session. Please don't distract your neighbors.

Complete all the readings before the start of each class. No unexcused late work will be accepted. No work will be accepted after the last day of class. I will discuss grades only in conversation during office hours, not over email.

Class communications will be sent to your GMU email account, which you must check.

If the campus closes, or if a class meeting needs to be canceled or adjusted due to weather or some other concern, students should check their email for updates on how to continue learning and for information about any changes assignments.

Unless otherwise specified, you should work on your own for assignments. In general, every source that you use should be acknowledged in a note or bibliography entry. Sources must be adequately paraphrased, meaning (at a minimum) that word choice, sentence and paragraph structure, and the order of ideas must be made your own. Whenever you use others' exact words, you must mark them as such by quotation marks or block quotations with accompanying citations. Plagiarism consists of presenting the writing, research, or analysis of others as one's own. It applies not only to using the text of another author's work verbatim without quotation marks and accurate citations but also to the taking of specific information, analysis or opinions---even if not in the exact words of the author---and presenting them without citation in one's own paper. Using AI-assistance for any paper is also plagiarism. Any instance of plagiarism will result in, at minimum, the student receiving a grade of 0 on the assignment, and the student will not be given the opportunity to rewrite the paper.

George Mason University has an [Honor Code](https://oai.gmu.edu/mason-honor-code/), which requires all members of this community to maintain the highest standards of academic honesty and integrity. Cheating, plagiarism, lying, and stealing are all prohibited. All violations of the Honor Code will be reported to the Honor Committee.

See the George Mason University [catalog](http://catalog.gmu.edu/) for general policies, as well as the university [statement on diversity](http://ctfe.gmu.edu/professional-development/mason-diversity-statement/).

If you are a student with a disability and you need academic accommodations, please see me and contact the [Office of Disability Resources](https://ds.gmu.edu/). All academic accommodations must be arranged through that office.

Students are responsible for verifying their enrollment in this class. Schedule adjustments should be made by the deadlines published in the Schedule of Classes. (Deadlines each semester are published in the Schedule of Classes available from the [Registrar's website](https://registrar.gmu.edu/).)
