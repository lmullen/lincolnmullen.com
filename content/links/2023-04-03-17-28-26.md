The Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media is launching a newsletter. You can [sign up here](https://airtable.com/shr4EDv3YKjl3NdZD). This is the best place to keep up with how our students and staff are creating history for public audiences. The first issue is out tomorrow, featuring news of a new podcast on the history of the American revolution; a grad student exchange with a European university; and a new data visualization about the plague in early modern London.
