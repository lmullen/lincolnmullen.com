My colleagues Jason Heppler and Mills Kelly [in the _Washington Post_ today](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/2023/04/02/exchange-civil-war-graffiti-digital/81d39558-d156-11ed-ac8b-cd7da05168e9_story.html) about their collaboration with two local public history sites in Northern Virginia. The houses contain graffiti left by Civil War soldiers, which they will be digitizing and preserving.
