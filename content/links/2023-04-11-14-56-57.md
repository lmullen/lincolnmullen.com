The Congregational Library and Archives has kindly invited me to talk about _America's Public Bible: A Commentary_ with them on April 19. The event is online and open to the public [if you register here](https://www.congregationallibrary.org/events/americaspublicbible). 

> Join us for a virtual discussion with Lincoln Mullen to celebrate the release of America’s Public Bible: A Commentary, an interactive scholarly work that uncovers the history of the Bible in the nineteenth- and early twentieth-century United States.
> 
> Throughout the nineteenth century and into the twentieth century, newspapers in the United States—even newspapers which were not published by a religious denomination or organization—made frequent recourse to the Bible. Newspapers printed sermons and Sunday school lessons. They featured jokes whose punchlines required familiarity with the Bible and aired political commentary that cited the Bible on all sides of a given issue.
> 
> By identifying and studying quotations in American newspapers, America’s Public Bible offers a commentary on how the Bible was used in public life, uncovering trends and patterns that would be invisible to a single scholar’s reading of these documents.
