podcast---[has joined R2 Studios](https://www.r2studios.org/blog/your-most-obedient-humble-servant-joins-the-r2-studios-network/)
at RRCHNM.

> _Your Most Obedient & Humble Servant_ is a women’s history podcast that
> showcases 18th and early 19th-century women’s letters that don’t always make
> it into the history books. Using her training as a historian and documentary
> editor, Kathryn Gehred and her guests dig into the story behind each letter
> and the lives of the women who wrote or received them.

> Gehred began the podcast in 2020 and has released 38 episodes with
> approximately 50,000 downloads to date. “I am THRILLED to announce thatYour
> Most Obedient & Humble Servantis joining the R2 Studios podcast network!,”
> Gehred said. “This means you're going to see more episodes, with better
> editing, produced on a regular schedule, with all the same great 18th and
> 19th-century scandals you've come to expect.”
