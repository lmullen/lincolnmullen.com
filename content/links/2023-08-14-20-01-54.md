I am grateful to have worked for Mills Kelly for the past four years as he has
served as the executive director at the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and
New Media. In
[a blog post on our website](https://rrchnm.org/about-rrchnm/passing-the-baton/),
he reflects on the last four years at RRCHNM, and a bit beyond.
