  mastodon: "The Roy Rosenzweig Prize for Creativity in Digital History went to Envisioning Seneca Village, a project that uses 3D models to study a majority Black community demolished to build Central Park. RRCHNM's founder Roy Rosenzweig wrote about Central Park and Seneca Village.

    One of the more enjoyable parts of leading RRCHNM is getting to chair the committee that selects the winner of the Roy Rosenzweig Prize for Creativity in Digital History. This year the prize went to Envisioning Seneca Village. Seneca Village was a mixed race but majority Black community located on what became the site of Central Park in New York City. The village was demolished to make way for the park in 1857. The digital project uses 3D models to show what the village looked like before its demise.

    The creators of the project were not the first digital historians to look at Seneca Village. RRCHNM's founder and his co-author Elizabeth Blackmar wrote about Central Park and Seneca Village in The Park and the People (Cornell University Press, 1992). So I sent one of our PhD students to the GMU archives to see what she could find in the Roy Rosenzweig papers. Alexandra Miller wrote this detailed and well-researched account of the public history of Seneca Village. https://rrchnm.org/news/lost-in-the-park-roy-rosenzweigs-public-history-legacy/

One of the more enjoyable parts of leading [RRCHNM](https://rrchnm.org) is getting to chair the committee that selects the winner of the Roy Rosenzweig Prize for Creativity in Digital History. This year the prize [went](https://rrchnm.org/news/roy-rosenzweig-prize-for-creativity-in-digital-history-winner/) to *Envisioning Seneca Village*. Seneca Village was a mixed race but majority Black community located on what became the site of Central Park in New York City. The village was demolished to make way for the park in 1857. The [digital project](https://envisioningsenecavillage.github.io) uses 3D models to show what the village looked like before its demise.

The creators of the project were not the first digital historians to look at Seneca Village.

Alexandra Miller wrote this [detailed and well-researched account](https://rrchnm.org/news/lost-in-the-park-roy-rosenzweigs-public-history-legacy/) of the public history of Seneca Village.

From Miller's post:

> As early as 1987, Rosenzweig had produced a list of 323 residents in the village. They were a mix of laborers, shop owners, and farmers. The information he collated included their full name, number of family members, ID number, age, years lived in the city, employment, birthplace, and the number of lots, shanties, framehouses, stables, sheds, and piggeries they owned. Most of the sources he pulled these names from were baptismal records. He also drew rudimentary plot maps of the village. In their 1992 book, *The Park and the People*, Rosenzweig and Blackmar included around thirty pages on Seneca Village, using it as the example of removal via eminent domain in creating Central Park.
