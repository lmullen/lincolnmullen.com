[This essay on RSS readers](https://www.terrygodier.com/phantom-obligation) asks "why do RSS readers look like email clients?" Though the essay is a little overwrought---if beautifully designed---the main point resonated with me. If RSS readers look like email, then they produce the sense of obligation that email produces:

> Brent borrowed email's interface, but RSS isn't people writing to you. It's people writing, period. You opted to be notified of their existence. The interface implied debt where none existed. The obligation became phantom.

The essay was compelling enough for me to go to the App Store and plunk down my ten bucks for [the author's new RSS reader](https://www.currentreader.app). I installed it and ... it was a buggy mess and a confusing interface. I don't want to be mean-spirited, but the app was so buggy that it was entirely unusable. I'd never consider asking for my $9.99 back, though, because I'm delighted to have an indie developer working on RSS in an inventive way. Maybe I'll return to the app after a few more months of development.

I don't think that the problem is the metaphor though. I hate going through my email inbox because it's mostly people asking me to do things I don't want to do. But my daughter just recently got her first real email account, and she's delighted to send and receive messages. And I look forward to having a few moments to open up [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com), because it's full of things I decided to read. In this case, I think the wine matters more than the wineskins.
