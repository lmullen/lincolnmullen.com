According to the whiteboard outside our kitchen, there are fourteen days left of
summer. So here is a summertime newsletter, heavy on the pictures and light on
the prose.

### Currently listening

{{< image src="merle.jpeg" alt="Merle Haggard's album, The Land of Many Churches" >}}

I found this double LP album for $3 at the [CD Cellar](https://cdcellarva.com)
in Falls Church. Merle Haggard and The Strangers were recorded live during
services at four different churches or chapels. I'm listening it to it for a
book I'm researching.

### Currently visualizing

{{< image src="cdsl.png" alt="A visualization from our paper" >}}

[Kellen Funk](https://kellenfunk.org) and I recently presented our work on
[Legal Modernism](https://legalmodernism.org) at the
[Conference on Data Science and Law](https://lawecon.ethz.ch/conferences-workshops/conference-on-data-science-and-law.html)
held at Fordham University. Above is one of the many visualizations from the
paper. This one is drawn from the dataset we have generated, which includes 8.2
million citations from 9,749 U.S. legal treatises published before 1926 to some
368,000 distinct U.S. cases.

another $350k grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities for our
[American Religious Ecologies](https://religiousecologies.org) project. Our

### Currently reading

{{< image src="fortifications.jpeg" alt="Fortifications in Tangier" >}}

This week my wife will send in the manuscript of her book for final copyediting.
The book is provisionally titled _The Olive Branch and the Sword: The United
States in the Mediterranean, 1800--1805_, and it will be published by Johns
Hopkins University Press. For our fifteenth wedding anniversary, we took a trip
to some of the sites in her book. So here we are outside the fortifications in
Tangier.
