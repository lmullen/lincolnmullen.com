"Working on It" is an occasional newsletter about American religious history, digital history, and the making thereof. The newsletter also links to recent blog posts, so it's not a bad way to subscribe to this website in general.  There's an explanation of the title in the [first issue](/newsletter/1/).

The thing to do is to type your email into the box below and then confirm your subscription. When you subscribe you will receive the most recent issue. Or, if you'd rather, you can subscribe to the [site feed](/blog/index.xml), which contains all the newsletter issues in addition to blog posts.
