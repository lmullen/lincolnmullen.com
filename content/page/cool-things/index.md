Here is a decidedly non-exhaustive list of things that I like or think are cool, within the narrow compass of what I'm willing to share publicly. My tastes are almost certainly mainstream. But I've learned that I like what I like.

## üë®üèª‚Äçüíª The web

I love the web, or at least the idea of the web. You should read Alan Jacobs's essay on "[Tending the Digital Commons](https://hedgehogreview.com/issues/the-human-and-the-digital/articles/tending-the-digital-commons)," and Cal Newport's [essay on a similar topic](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/can-indie-social-media-save-us). I wrote a [love letter to the IndieWeb](https://buttondown.email/lmullen/archive/love-letter-to-the-indieweb/). 

There are some great independent websites. [Robin Sloan](https://www.robinsloan.com/) is probably the coolest person on the internet, unless it is [Paul Ford](https://www.ftrain.com/). These personal websites are great to poke around on: [Jason Heppler](https://jasonheppler.org/), [Ben Schmidt](https://benschmidt.org/), [Alan Jacobs](https://ayjay.org/) (and [blog](https://blog.ayjay.org/)), [Dan Cohen](https://dancohen.org/).

[Reclaim Hosting](https://reclaimhosting.com/) is a great web host. [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog/) is a fun blogging, social media place.

## üñ• Technology and computing

A while back I [shared my setup](https://usesthis.com/interviews/lincoln.mullen/) with Uses This. 

## üíª Websites

Here are some websites I like to read:

- [Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/)
- [Uses This](https://usesthis.com/)
- [The Changelog](https://changelog.com/)

## üìö Books

Again, this is highly selective, but [recent books](https://weblog.lincolnmullen.com/reading/) that I have read are on my weblog. The [Epilogue](https://epilogue.micro.blog/) app from the creators of Micro.blog is a lightweight way of tracking reading.

## üíø Music

For [reasons](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674980846) that need not detain us, I did not listen to music widely when I was young. Well, that's not quite true: I listened very widely to classical music, which is something I am very grateful for. But now in middle age, I have gotten back into music. (Shockingly stereotypical, I know.) More about the music itself when I have more time, but country music is now my thing.

And yes, this development meant that I got a "proper stereo." I have been very pleased with the [NAD C338](https://nadelectronics.com/product/c-338-classic-digital-dac-amplifier/) for an amplifier, DAC, and streamer; the [NAD C538](https://nadelectronics.com/product/c-538-compact-disc-player/) for a CD player/transport; the [NAD C558](https://www.polkaudio.com/en-us/product/floor-standing-towers/s50) for a turntable; and the [Polk Audio S50](https://www.polkaudio.com/en-us/product/floor-standing-towers/s50) for speakers. I couldn't possibly need anything else, but doesn't mean I can't tease my children every time the [Crutchfield](https://www.crutchfield.com) catalog arrives.
