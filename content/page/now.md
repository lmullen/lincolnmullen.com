This page briefly describes what I am currently working on, or at least, the main things that I am trying to focus my attention on over the short term.

**Late January:**

- Gearing up to teach [Computational History](https://lincolnmullen.com/courses/data.2020/) again, and itching to actually write this [textbook](http://dh-r.lincolnmullen.com).
- Making all the pieces of [*America's Public Bible*](http://americaspublicbible.org) work together: database, website, interactive visualizations.
- Keeping all the RRCHNM balls in the air.
