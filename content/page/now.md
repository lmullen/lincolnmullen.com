This page briefly describes what I am currently working on, or at least, the main things that I am trying to focus my attention on over the short term.

**January:**

We are in that pleasant time in between semesters. Nevertheless, these are the main things I'm trying to do:

- Preparing a revised syllabus for "Computational History," a class on data analysis and visualization for grad students.
- Making all the pieces of [*America's Public Bible*](http://americaspublicbible.org) work together: database, website, interactive visualizations.
- Making a map of Catholic dioceses over time.
