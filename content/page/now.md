This page briefly describes what I am currently working on, or at least, the main things that I am trying to focus my attention on over the next month and semester.

**Summer 2020**

It's summer time, so that means I'm trying to get some real writing and research done. For the [American Religious Ecologies](https://religiousecologies.org) project, that means writing up a lot of our work so far and developing some new interactive visualizations. My main push is to try to finish the new version of [America's Public Bible](https://americaspublicbible.org), which I've been saying for much too long. And there is a side research project into legal texts which involves a lot of computational analysis. 

I'm also making a text adventure videogame with my daughter, which is fun.
