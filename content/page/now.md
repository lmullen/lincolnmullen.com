This page briefly describes what I am currently working on, or at least, the main things that I am trying to focus my attention on.

**November**

- Finishing up a grant application with John Turner for another phase in the [American Religious Ecologies](http://religiousecologies.org/) project.
- Regaining my ability to work with D3.js and trying to relearn modern JavaScript. To have some data to work with, learning PostGIS properly and writing an API layer in Go. The idea is to build a better stack for data visualization on the web, which will feed into American Religious Ecologies and America's Public Bible.
- As a manageable project that will give me something real to work on, creating a map of Catholic dioceses over time.

**This semester**:

- Teaching "[American Scriptures](https://lincolnmullen.com/files/american-scriptures.fall2019.pdf)."
- Teaching "[Web Programming for Historians](/courses/programming.2019/)."
