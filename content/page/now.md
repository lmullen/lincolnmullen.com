This page briefly describes what I am currently working on, or at least, the main things that I am trying to focus my attention on over the short term.

**Winter break:**

We are in that pleasant time in between semesters. Nevertheless, these are the main things I'm trying to do:

- Making all the pieces of [*America's Public Bible*](http://americaspublicbible.org) work together: database, website, interactive visualizations.
- Making a map of Catholic dioceses over time.
- Got to write a second issue of the [newsletter](https://buttondown.email/lmullen).
