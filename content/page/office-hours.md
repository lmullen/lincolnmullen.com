title: "Office hours"

If you are a student in the history department at GMU or a GRA at RRCHNM, you are always welcome to talk with me in office hours. For the time being, assume that all office hours will be held remotely via Webex, unless we specifically agree otherwise. 

Please create an office hours appointment below unless we've agreed on a different time.

**How to join a Webex call for office hours.** Please go to this URL to join my office hours: <https://gmu.webex.com/meet/lmullen>. The first time you go there you will likely need to install Webex, if you have not already done so. You will need a PIN to join the meeting, which I will give you in advance. The PIN number should also be in the email that you receive when you book an appointment. If there are other people in the queue, you might have to wait a few minutes.

**How to find my office for in-person meetings.** My office is Research Hall 484. It is located inside the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media. If you have trouble finding it, follow the signs on the fourth floor of Research Hall to RRCHNM, go into the center, and ask someone for directions.

**Booking an appointment.** Please click the booking button below or go to the [booking page](https://calendly.com/lincolnmullen/office-hours/) and pick your appointment. If the times that I have available do not work for you, you are welcome to [email me](mailto:lmullen@gmu.edu) to suggest a different time.
