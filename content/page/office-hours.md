Greetings. You probably landed here either because you are a student looking for
an office hours appointment or a collaborator looking to schedule a meeting. Please note that in academic year 2021--22 I will either be on a fellowship or on leave, and so I will only be taking meetings on Mondays. I
would like to do whatever I can to help you, but it is also the case that many
more people request my attention than I can possibly accommodate. To make this
work, could you please a time from the appropriate category below? These really
and truly are all of the times that I have available. When you select a time, you will be able to choose whether to meet in-person or
on Zoom.

**Office:** Research Hall 484, George Mason University<br>
**Zoom:** [My Zoom meeting room](https://gmu.zoom.us/j/8191376868?pwd=dFF5VzRXV2tpOGJQZG9LMFJmK25PZz09)
