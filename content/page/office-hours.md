Greetings. You probably landed here either because you are a student looking for
an office hours appointment or a collaborator looking to schedule a meeting.
Please use the links below to schedule a time. The meeting will be in person in
my office unless we arrange to meet on Zoom or some other place.

would be expected. If we don't know one another, please send me an email before
booking an appointment.
