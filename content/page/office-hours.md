If you are a student, you are always welcome to come talk with me in office hours. You can try dropping in, but I strongly encourage you to book an appointment. I often add extra office hours which may be more convenient to you, and sometimes things come up during my regular times. Booking an appointment will make sure we both know exactly when we will meet.

**Where.** My office is Research Hall 457. It is located inside the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media. If you have trouble finding it, follow the signs on the fourth floor of Research Hall to RRCHNM, go into the center, and ask someone for directions.

**When.** These are my typical office hours for the spring 2019 semester:

- Mondays, 11:00–12:00pm
- Wednesdays, 10:30–11:45am

**Booking an appointment.** [Go to the booking page.](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/selfsched?sstoken=UU94MzdPM1ZlU0ZqfGRlZmF1bHR8ZTg3NzRjZDZiYTMxNDU5ZjEzNjZkZTZkODAyODVmYWI). You may have to sign in with your Google account. You will see a page where you can browse through a calendar, and available appointments will show up as in the image below. Click on one to book an appointment.

If the times that I have available do not work for you, please [email me](mailto:lmullen@gmu.edu) and suggest three times that work for you.
