Greetings. You probably landed here either because you are a student looking for an office hours appointment or a collaborator looking to schedule a meeting. I would like to do whatever I can to help you, but it is also the case that many more people request my attention than I can possibly accommodate. To make this work, could you please a time from the appropriate category below? These really and truly are all of the times that I have available.

**Zoom link.** For the time being, all meetings are held via Zoom. Unless we have agreed on some other venue, please [use this Zoom link](https://gmu.zoom.us/j/8191376868?pwd=dFF5VzRXV2tpOGJQZG9LMFJmK25PZz09). If there are other people in the queue, you might have to wait a few minutes.

**Types of appointments.** Please select the appropriate type of appointment.

- [Office hours for undergraduates](#undergrad)
- [Office hours for graduate students and postdocs](#gradstudent)
- [Project meetings with collaborators](#projects)
