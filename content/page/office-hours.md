If you are a student or a GRA at RRCHNM, you are always welcome to come talk with me in office hours. Please do so by booking an appointment, since booking an appointment will make sure we both know exactly when we will meet.

**Where.** My office is Research Hall 457. It is located inside the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media. If you have trouble finding it, follow the signs on the fourth floor of Research Hall to RRCHNM, go into the center, and ask someone for directions.

**Booking an appointment.** You can browser through the dates and times I have available below. If the booking widget below does not work, then please go directly to the [booking page](https://calendly.com/lincolnmullen/office-hours/). If the times that I have available do not work for you, you are welcome to [email me](mailto:lmullen@gmu.edu) to suggest a different time. But you'll have to take my word that unless it is truly an exceptional circumstance, these really are all the times that I have available.
