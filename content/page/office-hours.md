Greetings. You probably landed here either because you are a student looking for
an office hours appointment or a collaborator looking to schedule a meeting. Please note that in academic year 2021--22 I will either be on a fellowship or on leave, and so I will only be taking meetings only at set times. Please use the link below to schedule a time. These really and truly are all of the times that I have available. Let's assume that a meeting will be on Zoom unless you and I arrange otherwise.

**Appointments:** [Book an office hours appointment](https://fantastical.app/lincoln-Un6G/office-hours)<br>
**Office:** Research Hall 484, George Mason University<br>
**Zoom:** [My Zoom meeting room](https://gmu.zoom.us/j/8191376868?pwd=dFF5VzRXV2tpOGJQZG9LMFJmK25PZz09)
