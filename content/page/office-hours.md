If you are a student in the history department at GMU or a GRA at RRCHNM, you are always welcome to talk with me in office hours. All office hours will be held remotely via Zoom.

Please create an office hours appointment below unless we've agreed on a different time.

**How to join a Zoom call for office hours.** Please go to [the URL below](https://gmu.zoom.us/j/8191376868?pwd=dFF5VzRXV2tpOGJQZG9LMFJmK25PZz09) to join my office hours via Zoom. The first time you go there you will likely need to install Zoom, if you have not already done so. The PIN number should also be in the email that you receive when you book an appointment. If there are other people in the queue, you might have to wait a few minutes.
