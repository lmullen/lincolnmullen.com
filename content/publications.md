{{% book title="The Chance of Salvation: A History of Conversion in America" image="chance-of-salvation-cover.jpg" year="2017" publisher="Harvard University Press" url="http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674975620" %}}

The United States has a long history of religious pluralism, yet Americans have often thought that people's faith determines their eternal salvation. The result is that Americans switch religions more often than any other nation. *The Chance of Salvation* traces the history of the distinctively American idea that religion is a matter of individual choice.

As nineteenth-century Americans confronted a growing array of religious options, pressures to convert altered the basis of American religion.  Evangelical Protestants emphasized conversion as a personal choice, while Protestant missionaries brought Christianity to Native American nations such as the Cherokee. African Americans created a distinctive form of conversion based on ideas of divine justice and redemption.  Mormons proselytized for a new tradition that stressed individual free will. American Jews resisted evangelism while winning converts to Judaism. Converts to Catholicism opted out of the system of religious choice by turning to Church authority. By the early twentieth century, religion in the United States was a system of competing options that created an obligation for more and more Americans to choose their own faith. Religion had changed from an inherited to a consciously chosen identity.

{{% book title="America’s Public Bible: Biblical Quotations in U.S. Newspapers" image="public-bible-screenshot.png" year="in progress" publisher="Stanford University Press" url="http://americaspublicbible.org/" %}}

*America's Public Bible* that explores how American newspapers from
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries used the Bible. Using the
techniques of machine learning, it identifies biblical quotations and
allusions in millions of newspaper papers from the Library of
Congress's *Chronicling America* collection and other newspaper
archives. The [initial version](http://americaspublicbible.org/) of the
site, which won the 2016 NEH [Chronicling America Data
Challenge](https://www.neh.gov/news/press-release/2016-07-25), is
available online. A much expanded version of the site is in progress,
and it will be published as a digital monograph by Stanford University
Press.
