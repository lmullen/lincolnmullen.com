  Generously funded by the Henry Luce Foundation, this podcast is under development at R2 Studios. 
  
  The podcast will explore antisemitism in U.S. history through narration, primary sources, and expert interviews. These stories will discuss how antisemitism developed alongside other forms of bigotry and hatred in the United States. Our themes are that antisemitism is a deep-rooted American problem, that it spans the political and religious spectrum of the United States, that it is intertwined with the history of race in America, and that understanding the history of American antisemitism makes it easier to oppose it in the present.
