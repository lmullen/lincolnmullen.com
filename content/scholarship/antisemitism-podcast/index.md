  Generously funded by the Henry Luce Foundation, this podcast is under development at R2 Studios. 

  How can Americans overcome a problem that they canâ€™t define, a bigotry whose particulars shift over time, a hatred that most consider a problem of the past rather than the present? RRCHNM's podcast explores instances and aspects of antisemitism in U.S. history through narration, primary sources, and expert interviews. These stories will discuss what antisemitism is and how it developed and persisted alongside other forms of bigotry and hatred in the United States. Episodes will relate to the podcast's broad themes: that antisemitism is a deep-rooted American problem, that it spans the political and religious spectrum of the United States, that it is intertwined with the history of race in America, and that knowledge and understanding of the history of American antisemitism makes it easier to identify and oppose it in the present.
