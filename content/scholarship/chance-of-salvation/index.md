description: |
  The United States has a long history of religious pluralism, and yet Americans have often thought that people’s faith determines their eternal destinies. The result is that Americans switch religions more often than any other nation. _The Chance of Salvation_ traces the history of the distinctively American idea that religion is a matter of individual choice.

  **Winner of the American Academy of Religion's 2018 prize for Best First Book in the History of Religions**: "Mullen takes a common trope about American religions—that they are about conversion and choice—and deploys it in astonishingly illuminating ways across the breadth of religious traditions. … Mullen clearly and convincingly demonstrates how pressures to convert changed the foundations of American religions. … This book is innovative, accessible, highly teachable, wise and mature."
