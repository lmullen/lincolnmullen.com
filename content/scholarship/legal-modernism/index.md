  Law and legal practice modernized in the nineteenth-century United States. The textual record of legal modernization is vast. Hundreds of volumes of regulations were formulated, copied, and re-formulated by legislatures. Millions of case reports became the authoritative building blocks for the thousands of treatises from which modern American law was constructed. We are studying and visualizing the history of the modernization of American law.
