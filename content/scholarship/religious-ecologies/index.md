  The American Religious Ecologies project is creating new datasets from historical sources and new ways of visualizing them so that we can better understand the history of American religion. 
  
  We are currently digitizing the 1926 Census of Religious Bodies. At the start of the twentieth century, the U.S. Census Bureau surveyed the nation's "religious bodies." These congregation-level schedules---some 232,154 of them---are a treasure trove of congregation- and place-specific data. 
  
  We are also transcribing the 1926 census into a dataset, and mapping and visualizing the data. These efforts contribute to a fuller and more vivid depiction of the religious landscape of the early twentieth-century United States.
