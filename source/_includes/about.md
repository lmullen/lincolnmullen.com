I am an [assistant professor](http://historyarthistory.gmu.edu/people/lmullen) in the [Department of History and Art History](http://historyarthistory.gmu.edu/) at [George Mason University](http://www.gmu.edu/), working on the history of American religions as a digital historian. I am primarily interested in synthetic works of history. And I am a historian who works primarily in the R programming language, for which I develop packages of interest to historians.

I am currently working on a book manuscript titled *The Varieties of Religious Conversion: The Origins of Religious Choice in the United States*. This book is a history of conversions between religions in the nineteenth-century United States. I also work on spatial history projects, and at the moment I am working on a spatial concordance to the WPA former slave narratives.  *[The Varieties of Religious Conversion: The Origins of Religious Choice in the United States](/research/#varieties)*. Manuscript in progress being revised from my [dissertation](/research/#dissertation).

*[Digital History Methods in R](http://dh-r.lincolnmullen.com/)*. Book manuscript combining programming techniques and digital history methods using the R programming language, freely available online while it is being written.

Text reuse package part of a collaboration with Kellen Funk.
