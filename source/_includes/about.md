I am an [assistant professor](http://historyarthistory.gmu.edu/people/lmullen) in the [Department of History and Art History](http://historyarthistory.gmu.edu/) at [George Mason University](http://www.gmu.edu/), working on the history of American religions as a digital historian. I write regularly on [my own blog](/blog/) and for the *[Religion in American History](http://usreligion.blogspot.com/search/label/lincoln%27s%20posts)* group blog.

I am currently working on a book manuscript titled *The Varieties of Religious Conversion: The Origins of Religious Choice in the United States*. This book is a history of conversions between religions in the nineteenth-century United States. It describes how the nature of religious identity in the United States changed over the course of the nineteenth century due to conversion, as more people came to conceive of their religion as an identity they had chosen rather than one they had inherited. You can [read more about this manuscript](http://notebook.lincolnmullen.com/Varieties%20of%20Religious%20Conversion) at my [Open History Notebook](http://notebook.lincolnmullen.com), where I keep track of the research for my various projects.

I also work on spatial history projects. At the moment I am working on a [spatial concordance to the WPA former slave narratives](http://notebook.lincolnmullen.com/Spaces%20of%20Slavery%20and%20Freedom). I work primarily in the R programming language. My book manuscript *[Digital History Methods in R](http://lincolnmullen.com/projects/dh-r/)* is freely available online while it is being written.
