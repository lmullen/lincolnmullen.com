I am an [assistant professor](http://historyarthistory.gmu.edu/people/lmullen) in the [Department of History and Art History](http://historyarthistory.gmu.edu/) at [George Mason University](http://www.gmu.edu/), working on the history of American religions as a digital historian. I write regularly on [my own blog](/blog/) and for the *[Religion in American History](http://usreligion.blogspot.com/search/label/lincoln%27s%20posts)* group blog.

I am currently working on a book manuscript titled *The Chance of Salvation: A History of Conversion in America*. This book is a history of conversions between religions in the nineteenth-century United States. It describes how the nature of religious identity in the United States changed over the course of the nineteenth century due to conversion, as more people came to conceive of their religion as an identity they had chosen rather than one they had inherited.
