title: "What Would Jesus Do? A Parable About Copyright"
---

Have you heard the saying “What would Jesus do?” Who hasn’t? In the
1990s the phrase became a fad among evangelical Christians, who printed
the abbreviation *WWJD?* on bracelets, t-shirts, and posters, spawning
in turn a host of mocking pop culture imitations. *WWJD* can provide a
useful lens for looking at [evangelical consumer culture][] of the late
twentieth century. But the phrase can also serve as a parable about
contemporary copyright law.

The phrase “What would Jesus do?” originated in a novel titled [*In His
Steps: What Would Jesus Do?*][], published in 1897 by Charles M.
Sheldon. Sheldon was a Congregational minister in Topeka, Kansas, and a
Progressive concerned with Christianity’s relationship to the social
politics of his day. His book is a parable about the Reverend Henry
Maxwell, a minister to a wealthy middle-class congregation. Maxwell
comes into contact with a poor man who owes his plight to
industrialization, and is thereby jarred from his complacency about
social issues. He challenges his congregation to seriously consider the
question “What would Jesus do?” in all their actions. As his
congregation takes up the challenge, their views on politics, class,
race, charity, and corporations fall in line with the social gospel.

The long reach of Sheldon’s *In His Steps* was due in large part to its
message, which appealed to both mainline and evangelical Christians, and
to its simple though not particularly literary prose. But its long reach
was also due to a simple mistake by Sheldon’s publisher: the book was
never properly copyrighted.

In the 1890s, copyright was opt-in, not opt-out. In order for a book to
be copyrighted, the publisher had to register it with the federal
government. Chicago Advance, Sheldon’s publisher, incorrectly registered
the copyright, and so the book was available in the public domain. Many
publishers issued their own editions of *In His Steps*, which sold
widely. About the sales of the book, [Paul Boyer writes][]:

> Owing to a defect in the copyright, sixteen different publishers soon
> had editions of the book in the market, and by the summer of 1897,
> 100,000 copies had been sold. And this was merely the beginning. While
> Sheldon’s own later estimate of 30,000,000 sales is overdrawn, Frank
> L. Mott, tabulator and chronicler of American best-sellers, suggests
> that a figure of 6,000,000 for total world sales would probably not be
> far amiss, with perhaps 2,000,000 of these in the United States.

To be sure, *In His Steps* would not have been a bestseller simply
because of a mistake in the copyright registration. Sixteen publishers
would not have issued the book unless it appealed to the reading public.
Nor can the resurgence of *WWJD?* in the 1990s be attributed to the
book’s being in the public domain—by that time the book would have long
been out of copyright no matter what. And it is worth noting that the
book was a best*seller*: the failure of copyright registration did not
mean that the book was available for free, just that Sheldon made hardly
any royalties from it. Even today, the book is [available for
purchase][] in many editions, though it is available free from
[several][] [sources][].

But would the explosive sales and long-standing popularity of Sheldon’s
*In His Steps* have been possible if the book had been subject to, say,
the [Copyright Act of 1976, or the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension
Act, or, worse, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act][copyright laws]?
If the point of copyright is “to promote the Progress of Science and
useful Arts, by securing for[*limited Times*][] to Authors and Inventors
the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries,”
perhaps there is something to be learned from the case of Charles
Sheldon and his novel—a fitting parable for a Progressive reformer,
indeed.
