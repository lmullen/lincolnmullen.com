Religious conversion is a topic of interest to many domains of
knowledge. Historians, social scientists, philosophers, and theologians
of every creed have studied and attempted to explain conversion. David
Zehnder is the rare theologian---or scholar of any discipline---who has
done the difficult work of crossing disciplinary boundaries to bring
back the fruits of disciplines not his own. The title of his book, _A
Theology of Religious Change: What the Social Science of the Conversion
Means for the Gospel_ indicates that Zehnder is a net importer of ideas,
and contributing back to the social sciences is not on his agenda. He is
interested in the pastoral, apologetic uses to which social scientific
findings can be put. But his primary task is to mine the psychological
and sociological literature on conversion in an attempt to resolve one
of theology's most longstanding questions: "the problem of why one
person believes the gospel and another does not" (141).

This "theologian's cross" is the question of how to reconcile the human
and the divine role in salvation. Zehnder's study of divinity has given
him a firm position on the question of God's role in salvation. He
subscribes to a theology of monergism---the belief that God is the only
active agent in salvation---that initially drew him to the theological
question of predestination, and which shapes the opening and concluding
chapters on theology as well many of the observations about the social
science of conversion in the middle five chapters.

But Zehnder is also willing to study the human side of conversion, and
has set upon the social sciences, especially sociology and psychology,
as the best way to approach questions. Reconciling the social sciences
and theology requires a theory of how those domains of knowledge relate
to one another. This book takes a "correlational" approach that "holds
theological and scientific claims in tension as different explanatory
means that cannot directly contradict one another" (xv). This theory has
its merits, but Zehnder is unable to consistently follow it because he
does occasionally find that social science contradicts his theology.

Chapters two through six, which present the findings of social science
on various topics, all follow the same pattern. A brief theological
or pastoral introduction is followed by an extensive review of social
scientific literature, after which Zehnder reflects on the use of the
social science for pastoral concerns and its implications for theology.
The book summarizes social scientific research on religious change,
transformations of individuals, parental influences, ideology, and
social ties as they relate to conversion. These summaries of social
science read like so many literature reviews, though the book is at
least more readable than many of the studies it summarizes. More
problematic is the tendency to treat most research as equally valid,
which flattens out the debates and disagreements within social science.
But it is in his pastoral reflections on social science that Zehnder
offers his most useful contribution.

The book's contributions to theology are more troublesome.
The assumption of monergism forces Zehnder to depart from his
"correlational" model whenever the findings of social science
contradict that central tenet. In chapter three, he correctly concludes
that most social scientific research concludes that conversion is
"activist"---that is, that people who convert tend to be "active
seekers." This poses a problem for both Zehnder's method and his
theology: "The active conversion is probably sociology's most direct
challenge to monergistic theology which holds that conversion is not .
. . 'a personal accomplishment'" (52--53). For Zehnder, this raises the
question "whether active seekers could think that they have chosen the
gospel out of a pure act of will and still have the gospel at all" (53).
To his credit, Zehnder tries to take a middle road on this question,
but still calls the church to action: "the church cannot view active
conversion as a normative viewpoint . . . and must continually offer its
corrective" (54).

This conclusion is unsurprising and unobjectionable, if one accepts
the premise of monergism. But for any Christian tradition for which
monergism and election are not the central preoccupations, the question
is not a live one and an opportunity has been missed. A more rigorous
application of Zehnder's own correlational model would have found much
more use in social science's findings about active conversion.

In sum, readers who are not concerned with the theological problems
implied by monergism, or who are inclined to see salvation as a
human choice as well as a divine choice, are not likely to find the
theological issues discussed in this book to be live questions. Readers
who are inclined to agree with Zehnder that theology is a divine choice
will find Zehnder's theological reasonings informed by social science to
be intriguing. I hope they will also find them salutary, for Zehnder's
willingness to approach both sides of the question should be applauded.
And all readers can find his desire to turn "theology's attention away
from unsolvable mysteries and toward the question of how the church can
communicate to people's needs" (141), as well as his helpful suggestions
to that end, to be profitable.
