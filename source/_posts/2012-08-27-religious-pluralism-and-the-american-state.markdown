This fall I'll be teaching a university writing seminar titled
'Religious Pluralism and the American State'. I've made the [syllabus][]
available online and I've put up a basic [course website][].

Here is the course description:

<!--more-->

> Two of the most pressing questions about American religion and its
> public role are intertwined: how should religions relate to one
> another, and how should religions relate to the state? In this class
> you will take up these two questions through the historical analysis
> of texts about the interactions of Protestant, Catholic, Jewish,
> Mormon, and Native American religions with one another and with the
> federal and state governments. You will investigate how law has
> regulated the public sphere and the civil square in which religious
> interactions take place, but also how religious actors have driven
> those interactions. We will trace the history of American pluralism,
> from the fact of diversity in eighteenth century to the idea of
> pluralism in the twenty-first century. Because this is a writing
> seminar, you will write three essays: one expositing a document about
> a religious conflict, a second interacting with other historiansâ€™
> interpretations, and a third based on original research into religious
> conflict.

I'm looking forward to the reading list for the course. We'll be reading
most of three great books: Steven K. Green's *The Second
Disestablishment: Church and State in Nineteenth-Century America*, David
Sehat's *The Myth of American Religious Freedom*, and William
Hutchison's *Religious Pluralism in America: The Contentious History of
a Founding Ideal*.

But I'm mostly looking forward to teaching the [primary sources][],
which range from eighteenth-century texts such as the Virginia Statute
for Religious Freedom and John Leland's *The Rights of Conscience
Inalienable*, to nineteenth-century texts such as essays by Isaac Mayer
Wise in the *Occident* and court cases about blasphemy, polygamy, and
Bible reading, to twentieth-century texts about Jehovah's Witnesses,
drugs, and the ministerial exception. (I try to bring the course right
up to the present by using *Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church
and School v. EEOC*.) There are a lot of 'echoes' in the texts: for
example, James Madison's 'Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious
Assessments' is quoted in several of the nineteenth- and
twentieth-century texts, and the question of school prayer and Bible
reading comes up again and again.

I think the problem of how an open society can both permit wild
religious diversity and full religious expression is one of the most
crucial questions facing our democracy. I hope this course will be a
small contribution to helping the students and myself think through the
question.
