I've been asked to give a [workshop][] at [THATCamp New England 2012][]
on Saturday, October 20. Here is the description of the workshop:

> **The Humanist's Operating System; or, Scholarship in Plain Text**

> An operating system is the most basic software on a computer, which
> allows the computer run higher order applications. Scholars also need
> an 'operating system'---a set of basic tools that work together
> reliably to handle the low level tasks of scholarship so scholars can
> concentrate on higher order thinking. We will begin this workshop by
> drawing some ideas from the philosophy of the Unix operating system,
> especially the idea that (almost) all scholarly work can be done in
> plain text. We will then experiment with Unix-style tools that can be
> used on any computer operating system. We will spend most of the
> workshop trying out the components of a plain-text scholarly operating
> system, including text editors ([take your pick][]), plain-text markup
> ([Markdown][]), document converters ([Pandoc][] with a nod to
> [LaTeX][]), and version control ([Git][]). Along the way we will also
> learn the basics of interacting with a computer through a command
> line.

> Participants will get more out of the workshop if they install
> [Pandoc][1] and a good text editor ([TextWrangler][] on Mac,
> [Notepad++][] on Windows) before the session. The links above to
> ProfHacker posts may also be helpful.

As a bonus, here is a video from AT&T about Unix [posted][] by [Caleb McDaniel][].
