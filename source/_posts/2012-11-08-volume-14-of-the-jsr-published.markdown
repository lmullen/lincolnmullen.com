Today the *JSR* editors ([Mike Pasquier][], [Luke Harlow][], [Art Remillard][], and [Emily Clark][]) published [volume 14][] of the *[Journal of Southern Religion][]*. This issue has a great line up of articles, especially the forum on "Religion in the Early South" guest edited by [Rebecca Goetz][].

My technical innovation for this issue was generating EPUB and Kindle e-books of the issue. To do so, I used a Ruby program that [I coded][].  The [source code][] is on GitHub, and I released the utility as a [RubyGem][]. I was surprised by how many people downloaded the Gem.  Sure, the downloads were not in the tens of thousands, but at least sixty people have downloaded the latest version.
