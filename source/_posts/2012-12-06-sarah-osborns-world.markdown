At the Anxious Bench, Thomas Kidd [lists][] "Five Compelling Religious
Biographies." Among them is Catherine Brekus's new [book][], *Sarah
Osborn's World: The Rise of Evangelical Christianity in Early America*,
which Kidd calls "the best biography we have on a female evangelical in
colonial America" and also "simply one of the best books I have read on
the life of an American evangelical, female or male."
