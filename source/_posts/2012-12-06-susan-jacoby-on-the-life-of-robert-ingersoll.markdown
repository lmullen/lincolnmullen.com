The history of American secularism is a mostly neglected field, except a
few gems such as James Turner's *Without God, Without Creed: The Origins
of Unbelief in America* and Amanda Porterfield's *Conceived in Doubt:
Religion and Politics in the New American Nation*. In the most recent
issue of *The American Scholar*, Susan Jacoby [offers][] a treatment of
the life of Robert Ingersoll that verges on hagiography, complete with
the threat of martyrdom:

> His portliness impelled the *Oakland Daily Evening Tribune* to note
> that, in another century, the amount of fat in the Great Agnostic’s
> body would have produced a “spectacular auto da fé.”

As in her book, *Freethinkers: A History of American Secularism*, Jacoby
writes history in the same pattern as her opponents, "those who wish to
recreate the country’s mythic origins in their own image." Still,
Ingersoll deserves to be better known as an important figure from the
nineteenth century, and perhaps Jacoby's recent [biography][], *The
Great Agnostic*, will be a contribution.

**Update:** Timothy Larsen [reviews][] Jacoby's biography, and finds it
riddled with errors and misinterpretations (via [Alan Jacobs][]).
