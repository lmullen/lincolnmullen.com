*Christianity Today* [reports][] a forthcoming study by sociologist
Philip Schwadel that there is a growing "intensity gap" between
Protestants and Catholics, "with some 56 percent of evangelicals
describing themselves as 'strongly affiliated' with their religion
compared with 35 percent of Catholics."

At the *First Things* blog *On the Square*, James Rogers [explains][] 
that the gap in enthusiasm could be growing because less-committed 
evangelicals are dropping their affiliation to evangelicalism 
altogether, a finding that fits with Pew's October [report][] that "in 
the last five years alone, the unaffiliated have increased from just 
over 15% to just under 20% of all U.S. adults."
