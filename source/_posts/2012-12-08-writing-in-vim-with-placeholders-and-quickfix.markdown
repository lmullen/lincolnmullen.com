In his famous [essay][] on "History as a Literary Art," Samuel Eliot
Morrison advises, "When you once are writing, go on writing as long as
you can; there will be plenty of time later to shove in the footnotes or
return to the library for extra information," and, "Donâ€™t stop to
consult your notes for every clause or sentence: it is better to get
what you have to say clearly in your mind and dash it off; then, after
you have it down, return to your notes and compose your next few pages
or paragraphs."

I try to follow this advice when I'm writing by leaving notes or markers
in the text when I'm missing a fact or a reference. Following up on my
[post][] about Vim yesterday, here is how I manage these markers in Vim.

<!--more-->

First, I insert the markers in a standard form: `{TODO}` is my generic
marker; `{PAGE}` marks a missing reference; `{FACT}` marks a missing
date or the like. I insert these markers using [vim-snipmate][] but any
method will do.

Second, I use the line below to highlight these markers in the text. I 
have the line in `~/.vim/after/syntax/pandoc.vim`, but you could also 
put it in your `.vimrc`.

{% codeblock %}
match Error '{\w\+}'
{% endcodeblock %}

The result looks like this:

These markers then come in handy when it's time to clean up the draft. I
could search for the markers, but this keymapping makes things easier:

{% codeblock %}
nnoremap <leader>{ :vimgrep /{\w\+}/ %<CR>:copen<CR>
{% endcodeblock %}

That keymapping puts all of the markers into Vim's [quickfix][] buffer, 
which gives me a list of all the needed correction and lets me jump from 
one to another easily. It looks like this:
