At *First Things*, Kevin White [explains][] how the microphone drove
changes in the liturgy of the Mass, including the "elimination of Latin
from the Mass and of the turning around of the priest to face the
congregation."

> The notion of hearing Mass has since been displaced by the ideal of
> active participation at Mass, and to be active, it is thought, means
> to produce, as well as attend to, sound.
