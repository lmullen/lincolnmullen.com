[John Unsworth][], [Dave Wedaman][], and [Ryan Cordell][] have organized
four days of digital humanities events in Boston, March 15--19. This is
an exciting DH pair of conferences. I'm hoping to organize a panel for
"DH the Next Generation" on digital historical methods in the
traditional dissertation---more on that to follow. Here is the [CFP][];
here is Wedaman's announcement:

> Days of DH is two digital humanities events in Boston, March 15 - 19,
> 2013.

> March 15-16, is "DH the Next Generation." Hosted by Simmons Graduate
> School of Library and Information Science and organized by John
> Unsworth, it will focus on issues of the Digital Humanities as they
> relate to graduate students and junior faculty and will feature a mix
> of formal presentations and moderated discussion sessions.

> March 18-19 is "Days of DH." Hosted by the new NULab for Texts, Maps,
> and Networks at Northeastern University and organized by Ryan Cordell
> and a team of others, it will include a grants workshop with the NEH
> Office of Digital Humanities, a methods workshop, keynotes by Julia
