From Nicholas J. Healy's 
[review](http://www.firstthings.com/article/2012/12/jacob-and-esau) of 
John Connelly, *From Enemy to Brother: The Revolution in Catholic 
Teaching on the Jews, 1933--1965* (Harvard University Press, 2012):

> Connelly's extensive research uncovered a surprising fact. "From the 
> 1840s until 1965, virtually every activist and thinker who worked for 
> Catholic-Jewish reconciliation was not originally Catholic. Most were 
> born Jewish. Without converts, the Catholic Church would not have 
> found a new language to speak to the Jews after the Holocaust." ...
> Confronted by a racist ideology that had made deep inroads in Catholic 
> thinking in Germany and Austria, these converts discovered through 
> bitter struggle that it was necessary to unconver and heal a deeply 
> rooted contempt for the Jewish people.
