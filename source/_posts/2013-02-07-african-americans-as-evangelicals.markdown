One of the most interesting and important questions in the history of
evangelicalism is why African Americans who share many of the same
doctrines and practices as evangelicals have not been studied as
evangelicals. In other words, why does race trump religion as an
identity, and is does this divide reflect the history or the practices
of historians? I first came across this question in the work of [Ed
Blum][] and [Paul Harvey][]. In the past couple weeks [John Fea][] has
asked "[Where are the Studies of Twentieth-Century Black
Evangelicalism][]," providing a preliminary list of literature in that
post and in a [follow-up post][].

Yesterday at the *Anxious Bench* [Miles S. Mullin II][] provided two
historical reasons for the divide in a post on "[The Quandry of African
American Evangelicalism][]":

The first reason was that the National Association of Evangelicals did
want African American denominations to join, but was not interested in
dealing with race:

> Somehow, they expected African Americans to ignore the issue of race
> and unite with the predominantly white NAE based on core doctrinal

> African Americans since the Civil War. As a result, few African
> Americans joined the NAE either as individuals or groups while many
> segregationists fit comfortably within its ranks. Further, the NAE’s
> leadership actively courted the SBC, a denomination whose grassroots
> support of segregation at mid-century is well-documented. In later
> years, as the NAE persistently avoided racial issues in order to avoid
> alienating the segregationist elements of its membership, the few
> African Americans that had joined left to form the National Black (née
> Negro) Evangelical Association in 1963.

The second reason was that African Americans unified across doctrinal
lines in the civil rights struggle, including black scholars such as
W.E.B. DuBois and Carter Woodson:

> In the twentieth century, African American leaders recognized that a
> successful struggle towards full equality depended upon solidarity,
> and they turned the racial identity hoisted upon them by others to
> their own purposes. As they struggled towards full equality, they
> embraced race vis-à-vis any denominational or pan-denominational (e.g.
> evangelicalism) as their primary self-identity. ... Organizers and
> activists of a later generation followed in the same mold. Thus,
> Orthodox Presbyterian Minister C. Herbert Oliver, theologically
> progressive Baptist minister Martin Luther King, Jr., and atheist A.
> Philip Randolph all made common cause in the freedom struggle for
> African American equality.

**Update:** I see that Fea has already [excerpted][] Mullin's post. A
more diligent blogger, who can find?
