*[This post originally appeared at [ProfHacker][].]*

If you want to learn methods, techniques, or technologies that are
outside your usual scholarly ambit, then you often have to learn them in
small sections as you find time. That's why I was glad to learn about [R
Twotorials][].

R, according to the R Project's [website][], "is a free software
environment for statistical computing and graphics." It's a programming
language useful for analyzing data and creating graphics, especially if
you're using statistical methods.[^1] It's also the language that
Matthew Jockers [suggests you learn][] if you're interested in digital
humanities.

[R Twotorials][] is a set of some ninety screencasts, each two minutes
long, that teach you how to use R. Created by graduate student [Anthony
Damico][], a statistical analyst at the Kaiser Family Foundation, the
screencasts are fast-paced and entertainingly bombastic. You can get a
flavor for the screencasts and a sense of how R might be useful by
watching this video on [how to make simple plots in R][].

As Damico says in the very first video, you'll need to watch a lot of
the screencasts before you can do something useful with R: "R will not
give you instant gratification." But because the concepts are broken
down into two minute segments, it's easy to start and keep on learning.

ProfHackers have written about learning to program before: Jason wrote
about how to "[Become Code Literate with Codecademy][]"; Anastasia wrote
about a [new year's resolution][] to learn programming and about
*[Program or Be Programmed][]*; Ryan [wrote about learning Ruby][] with
Hackety-Hack and [Jason Heppler's][] *[The Rubyist Historian][]* (which
I also recommend).

**Are you learning a programming language (or anything else) in the odd
moments of the day?**

**Update February 8:** Anthony graciously wrote in to correct my error.
He is a statistical analyst at the Kaiser Family Foundation and an all
around good guy, not a graduate student.

[^1]: No, I'm not qualified to compare R to SAS, SPSS, Stata, 
Processing, or anything else.
