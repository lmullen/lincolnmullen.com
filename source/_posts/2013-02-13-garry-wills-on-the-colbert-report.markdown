This is an astounding [interview][] of Garry Wills on the *Colbert
Report*. On the one hand, professed-Catholic Wills denies the validity 
of transubstantiation ("it's a fake"), last rites, the priesthood, and 
the papacy like a low-church Protestant. On the other hand, Wills bases 
some of his arguments on denying the usefulness of the book of Hebrew 
for theology like a ... well, not like a Catholic or most Protestant 
traditions. It's hard to figure out where Wills coming from.
