Last August the Boston Digital Humanities Consortium formed "to pursue 
shared funding opportunities; organize a series of events; network with 
digital humanities centers, organizations, and societies worldwide; and 
encourage local discussion of digital humanities and related topics." 
They now have a [website](http://bostondh.org) where you can subscribe 
to their mailing list. They also have the most comprehensive news and 
calendar for Boston-area DH events, so it's worth checking out. If you 
want to be able to post events to the site's blog, you can e-mail [Dave 
Wedaman](wedaman@brandeis.edu).
