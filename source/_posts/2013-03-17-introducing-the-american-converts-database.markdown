This past weekend at the "[Digital Humanities: The Next Generation][]"
conference, my collaborator [Erin Bartram][] and I debuted a project we
have just started working on. **[The American Converts Database][]** is
a database of people who experienced a religious conversion in the
United States.

Converts Database]

[Erin][Erin Bartram] and I are collaborating on the project because both
our dissertations are about converts. Erin is writing about [Jane Minot
Sedgwick II][] and networks of female friends who converted to
Catholicism. I am writing about nineteenth-century converts between
Protestantism and Catholicism, between Christianity and Judaism, between
native or African religions and Christianity, between mainstream
denominations and new religious movements such as the Mormons, and
between religion and irreligion. We met at a [panel on Catholic
converts][] at ACHA 2013, and realized that collaborating on a database
would help us both with our research. We have a few other people who have
expressed interest in collaborating as well.

The project is in very early stages: an incomplete rough draft, if you
will. We'll post more information about the database as we develop it
further. In the meantime you might take a look at the [featured
items][The American Converts Database] on the main page.
