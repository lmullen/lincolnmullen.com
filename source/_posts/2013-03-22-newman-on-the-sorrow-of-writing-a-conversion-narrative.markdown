John Henry Cardinal Newman in *Apologia Pro Vita Sua* [describing][] the
sorrows of writing about his conversion:

> And now that I am about to trace, as far as I can, the course of that
> great revolution of mind, which led me to leave my own home, to which
> I was bound by so many strong and tender ties, I feel overcome with
> the difficulty of satisfying myself in the account of it, and have
> recoiled from doing so, till the near approach of the day, on which
> these lines must be given to the world, forces me to set about the
> task. For who can know himself, and the multitude of subtle influence
> which act upon him? and who can recollect, at the distance of
> twenty-five years, all that he once knew about his thoughts and his
> deeds, and that, during a portion of his life, when even at the time
> his observation, whether of himself or of the external world, was less
> than before or after, by very reason of the perplexity and dismay
> which weighed upon him,---when, though it would be most unthankful to
> seem to imply that he had not all-sufficient light amid his darkness,
> yet a darkness it emphatically was? And who can suddenly gird himself
> to a new and anxious undertaking, which he might be able indeed to
> perform well, had he full and calm leisure allowed him to look through
> everything that he has written, whether in published works or private
> letters? but, on the other hand, as to that calm contemplation of the
> past, in itself so desirable, who can afford to be leisurely and
> deliberate, while he practises on himself a cruel operation, the
> ripping up of old grief, and the venturing again upon the "infandum
> dolorem" of years, in which the stars of this lower heaven were one by
> one going out? I could not in cool blood, nor except upon the
> imperious call of duty, attempt what I have set myself to do. It is
> both to head and heart an extreme trial, thus to analyze what has so
> long gone by, and to bring out the results of that examination. I have
> done various bold things in my life: this is the boldest: and, were I
> not sure I should after all succeed in my object it would be madness
> to set about it.

A dissertation epigraph?
