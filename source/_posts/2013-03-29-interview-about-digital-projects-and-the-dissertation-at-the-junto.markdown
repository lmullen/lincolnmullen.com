At the [Digital Humanities: The Next Generation][] conference a couple
weeks ago, I caught up with my colleague [Sara Georgini][]. Sara is a
PhD candidate at Boston University, and an editor of the [Adams
Papers][] at the [Massachusetts Historical Society][]. She is writing
what promises to be a fascinating dissertation about the religious lives
of several generations and centuries of the Adams family, from Deacon
John Adams to Charles Francis Adams.

Sara writes for [The Junto][], and she was kind enough to arrange an
e-mail interview with [Jean Bauer][], creator of [Early American Foreign
Service Database][] and [Project Quincy][], and with [Erin Bartram][]
and me, collaborators on [The American Converts Database][], about
digital methods in the history dissertation.

You can read the [full interview here][]. Here are Jean and Erin leading
off with answers to the first question.

> **JUNTO: At what point in researching your dissertation topic, did a
> "digital" light bulb go off? Can you describe how you chose to
> incorporate digital research methods or new technology in your work,
> and how your colleagues reacted to that idea?**
>
> **BAUER:** I was already working on other digital history projects,
> designing prosopographical databases for The Dolley Madison Digital
> Edition and Documents Compass when my original plans to do an
> intellectual history of early U.S. Foreign Policy began to unravel. As
> I became more and more interested in the communication networks and
> day-to-day experience of American diplomats and consuls, I realized
> that the work I was doing for my summer jobs could translate into my
> own research interests.
>
> **BARTRAM:** While I think I was always looking for ways that
> technology could make my note-taking, organization, and writing
> processes smoother (and keep me from forgetting things), I have been
> pretty conventional in terms of the product of my research. A few of
> my colleagues at UConn are working on digital projects separate from
> their dissertations, so when Lincoln and I first started talking about
> creating the database, I had some people to bounce ideas off of.
