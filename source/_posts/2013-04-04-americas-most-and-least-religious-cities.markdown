*Atlantic Cities* has an [article][]about "America's Most (and Least)
Religious Metro Areas." Based on a [Gallup survey][], the data shows
that "the most religious metros as well as states are in the South,
while the least religious are in in the Northeast and West Coast." The
post has a great map, which I can't reproduce here. The author
elaborates on religiosity's correlations to other variables, such as
income, working class jobs, and education, then concludes:

> "Politicos on the left and right like to explain religious voters'
> proclivity purely in terms of values. But this misses a central point
> - that religion is inextricably bound up with the nation's underlying
> economic and geographic class divide."

I completely agree that religiosity is connected to class. But surely
*religion* has something to do with religiosity. It matters that Provo
(the most religious city) is heavily Mormon, that Boston (in the bottom
10) is heavily Catholic, that Florida and New York have more Jews than
other places, that Baptists are the largest denomination in the South,
and so on. Religion is connected with class, but it is not just
epiphenomenal, a marker of something deemed more significant like
politics or economics.
