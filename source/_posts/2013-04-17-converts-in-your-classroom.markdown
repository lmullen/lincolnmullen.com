If you're writing a syllabus for an American history or religion course
and want to include a digital assignment, then I have a proposal for
you. Why not give your students an assignment to contribute to the
[American Converts Database][]?

The [American Converts Database][] is a [collaborative effort][] to
catalog people who experience conversions in American history. I'm first
a nineteenth century historian, second an early Americanist, and the
records in the database so far reflect that, but the database also takes
in twentieth century conversions too.

There are a lot of sources that are low-hanging fruit for
undergraduates, such as published conversion narratives. If you have a
unit on Puritans, the conversion relations from Thomas Shepard's
Cambridge congregation have been published. If you have a unit on the
Great Awakening, you'll find plenty of accessible sources, including the
relations from East Windsor, Connecticut, that Ken Minkema published.
There are also more demanding sources, if your students need a
challenge. Students can mine digitized newspapers, such as [Chronicling
America][] or the paid collections your library might subscribe to, and
they'll find [notices][] of [conversions][], which are often quite
detailed. If you want your students to get into the archives, there is a
good chance that there is an archive or library near you with
collections of interest. You could even do someone famous, like [Marilyn
Monroe][].

Of course, one of the beneficiaries of your assigning such a project to
your students would be the database, and thus, my research and the
research of other historians. But if I didn't think that these kinds of
assignments primarily benefited students, I wouldn't assign them in [my
own courses][]. This could be a chance for students to learn historical
skills: research, transcription, putting people and events in context.
It's also a chance to learn about digital skills, from contributing to a
project to thinking about its design. The database runs on [Omeka][],
which is widely used for digital history projects. Pretty soon your
students will bump into the intellectual problems of categorizing people
in a database, which I think is a useful way to teach the historian's
problem of selecting and arranging evidence.

If this interests you, [send me a note][] or leave a comment and we'll
make arrangements.
