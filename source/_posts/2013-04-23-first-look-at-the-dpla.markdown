*[This post originally appeared at [ProfHacker][].]*

Last Thursday at noon the Digital Public Library of America launched its
website. The opening festivities, which had been booked solid with a
long wait list for weeks, were canceled, since the venue at the main
branch of the Boston Public Library was adjacent to the site of [the
bombing in Boston earlier that week][dpla-logo]. But the DPLA, which is
a website and not a location, went ahead with the launch of the public
service anyway.

The DPLA is a project that gathers together the digital collections from
many partner institutions. The DPLA aggregates the metadata for these
items and points users to the digital copies available at the partners’
websites. As more and more institutions join the DPLA, it will be the
universal place to search for open digital resources. The DPLA itself
gives a [fuller explanation][] of what it does:

> -   **A *portal* that delivers students, teachers, scholars, and the
>     public to incredible resources, wherever they may be in America.**
>     Far more than a search engine, the portal provides innovative ways
>     to search and scan through the united collection of millions of
>     items, including by timeline, map, format, and topic.
> -   **A *platform* that enables new and transformative uses of our
>     digitized cultural heritage**. With an application programming
>     interface (API) and maximally open data, the DPLA can be used by
>     software developers, researchers, and others to create novel
>     environments for learning, tools for discovery, and engaging apps.
> -   **An advocate for a strong *public option* in the twenty-first
>     century**. For most of American history, the ability to access
>     materials for free through public libraries has been a central
>     part of our culture, producing generations of avid readers and a
>     knowledgeable, engaged citizenry. The DPLA will work, along with
>     like-minded organizations and individuals, to ensure that this
>     critical, open intellectual landscape remains vibrant and broad in
>     the face of increasingly restrictive digital options. The DPLA
>     will seek to multiply openly accessible materials to strengthen
>     the public option that libraries represent in their communities.

The DPLA has over two million items in its catalog so far. Some of these
items are displayed in [exhibitions][], such as this [exhibit about
Prohibition][]. You can access all the rest by searching or browsing
categories. For example, my first search at the DPLA was “[religious
conversion][]“–the topic of my dissertation. One of the results is this
[1832 letter][] by William Hazzard Barnwell, describing the conversion
of some family members and the religious instruction of his slaves. The
DPLA [item][1832 letter] provides me with the metadata about the letter,
and a link to a [scan hosted][] at the College of Charleston Libraries,
the institution that holds the manuscript letter. The DPLA search is
straightforward, but it has the added feature of displaying the items on
a timeline or a map.

One of the remarkable things about the DPLA is its openness. The
governance of the DPLA is open in that its planning [initiatives have
been open][Screen shot of DPLA timeline] and available for public
comment. The source code that runs the DPLA is [available on GitHub][],
and developers have been organizing “hackathons” to improve the code
both before and after the formal launch. Most important, the DPLA has an
[open API][] and [open data][], which allows developers to build
applications on top of the DPLA, and which allows researchers to access
the collections programmatically. I’m no expert on metadata or APIs, but
it’s apparent from their description of the [philosophy behind the
API][] that the DPLA has thought out the way they represent data in
detailed and thought-provoking ways.

The DPLA launch has been well reported. Here are just a few of the
articles, beginning with recent coverage and going back to discussions
of the development of the DPLA:

-   Chronicle of Higher Education: “[Free to All][]” by Robert Darnton
    New York Review of Books: “[The National Digital Public Library Is
    Launched!][]” by Robert Darnton
-   The Atlantic: “[Now, With No Further Ado, We Present … the Digital
    Public Library of America!][]” by Rebecca J. Rosen
-   DPLA Blog: “[Welcome to the Digital Public Library of America][]“
-   DPLA Blog: “[A Proud Day for the DPLA][]“
-   Library Journal: “[What is the DPLA?][]” by John Palfrey
-   The Atlantic: “[Inside the Quest to Put the World’s Libraries
    Online][]” by Esther Yi
-   The Atlantic: “[How to Build the Great Online Library][]” by Rebecca
    J. Rosen

Here’s to the hardworking [DPLA staff][]–Dan Cohen, Emily Gore, Amy
Rudersdorf, Kenny Whitebloom, and probably others–[board of
directors][], [committees][], [partner institutions][], and [funders][].
The DPLA is already a useful tool with some amazing functionality, and
as more partners join the effort, the DPLA will only become more
important to scholars and to the nation.
