*[This post originally appeared at [ProfHacker][].]*

We’ve [written a lot][] about plain text at ProfHacker, from an
introduction to [Markdown][], to using [Pandoc][], to [creating
slides][] from plain text. One thing I’d like to be able to do with
plain text is this: Often I’d like to grab some text from a website in
plain text. Copying and pasting into a text editor loses links and
italics, while pasting into a word processor brings a lot of junk
formatting with it. It’d be nice to be able to copy a website’s text in
Markdown.

[Brett Terpstra][], the creator of [nvALT][] (another ProfHacker
[favorite][]), has created a website to do just that. His
[Markdownifier][] converts a website to plain text, preserving the
essential formatting in Markdown.

The service has a few useful features. It can use Readability to strip
out all the extraneous formatting. A button will copy the Markdown to
your clipboard. And the site offers several bookmarklets so that you can
easily use it on any website.
