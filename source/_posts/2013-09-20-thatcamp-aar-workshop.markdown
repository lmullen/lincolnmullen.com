At [THATCamp American Academy of Religion][] on November 22 I will be
giving this workshop. I think they wanted me to do it because of [this
post][].

> **Data Analysis for Humanists**

> Humanities scholars now have access to a range of data sets and
> techniques for analyzing them that were previously regarded as the
> province of scholars in other disciplines. Three kinds of data
> analysis are common in academic research: mapping, text mining, and
> quantitative analysis. In this workshop, we'll try our hands at all
> three, using data sets of interest to scholars of religion. We will
> make maps from the missions of the Paulist Fathers, do some
> quantitative analysis of religious demographic data, and mine the
> texts of the Oxford Movement's *Tracts for the Times*. By bringing
> these common kinds of data analysis together, we will learn the basic
> practices and theories which underlie all of them. Of course we will
> have occasion to discuss what data analysis means from a humanistic
> perspective.

> During this workshop we will get hands-on with the [statistical
> programming language R][]. While there are many tools to make maps,
> mine texts, and analyze numbers, R is especially powerful because it
> can perform all of these types of analysis. R is a favorite tool of
> academics, Google, and the New York Times, so it has strong support.
> You are encouraged to [install R][] (the programming language itself)
> and the desktop version of [R Studio][] (a tool to help you use R) in
> advance. Self-starters can watch some of [Google's video introductions
> to R][] to acquire the basics. While you will benefit from learning
> some of the theory behind the analysis even without using R, there is
> no substitute for performing the analysis yourself, and you'll pick up
> the basics of a powerful digital humanities tool.
