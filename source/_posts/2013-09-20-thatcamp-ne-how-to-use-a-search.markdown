At [THATCamp New England][] on October 18, Erin Bartram and I will be
giving this workshop.

> **How to Use a Database for Historical Research**

> Erin Bartram and Lincoln Mullen

> This workshop will investigate the intellectual problem of how to
> create a database for historical research. By database, we don't mean
> a commercial database from which one finds primary sources, but rather
> a database that is an intellectual model of one's research. The
> workshop will have two parts. In the first part, we will discuss the
> form of the database and the problem of how to model historical
> research. We will address such questions as, What is a database? What
> fields should my database have? How do I represent uncertainty in a
> database? How do I cite my sources? The second part of the workshop
> will deal with the question of how to make a historical argument from
> a database. We will address such questions as, How do I get my data
> out of the database and into a useable form? How do I make maps and
> charts from my data? How do I deal with the perennial historian's
> problem of selection?

> For the hands-on part, we will use Omeka and the universe of tools
> surrounding it. People planning to attend this workshop are encouraged
> to sign up for an account at [Omeka.net][] and investigate the
> following online databases created by historians in the course of
> their research:

> -   [American Converts Database][]
> -   [Papers of the War Department][]
> -   [Neatline demos][]

> Advanced users who are comfortable with programming languages may wish
> to download the latest version of the [Omeka Client Ruby gem][].
