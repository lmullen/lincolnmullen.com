**Update February 24, 2014 at 1:50 p.m.:** *I improved the regular
expression that parses out first names, so the charts and table have
been updated with fewer unknowns.*

One of the useful questions that can be asked of any data set is about
the significance of gender. Unfortunately almost all of the data sets
that I have gotten to analyze don't record gender. I'm willing to hazard
a guess that that is true for many if not most data sets of interest to
historians. However, many data sets, like the one I'm working on for
history dissertations, do include a list of names, and first names are a
pretty good indicator of gender.

But names are an imperfect indicator of gender. To begin with, you need
a list of male and female names to assign a gender to a record. (There
are a little under 12 thousand unique first names in the dissertations
data set.) But the gender associated with names also varies over time.
(Curiously, it seems that names tend to switch from male to female, but
not the other way round.) [Cameron Blevins][] had the really smart idea
to look up the gender of names as they vary over time by using [Social
Security Administration's names data set][]. He and I are working
together to compare the usefulness of his method in our respective data
sets, so I'll write about the details later. (In the mean time, here is
Cameron's [implementation in Python][] and an [R package][] that I
wrote. The READMEs explain more about the method.)

Using that method, I've guessed the gender of the first names in the
dissertations data set, and produced this chart, which shows the number
of dissertations produced in absolute terms.(The "unknowns" are names
which did not appear in the Social Security Administration data for the
given time period; as you would expect, in most cases they are
non-European names.)

Another way to examine this trend is to look at the proportion of male
and female writers of history dissertations over time, which smooths out
changes in the absolute number of dissertations produced. As you can
see, the proportion of dissertations written by women has steadily
increased since the 1950s. It appears to be plateauing with men
producing a few percentage points more dissertations than women. (Keep
in mind though that the number of names I was unable to identify is
substantial, about 10% for each year through the 2000s.)

If you want the percentages of dissertations written by men and women in
tabular form, here it is.
