title: 'The Return of the <em>Longue Durée</em> in American Religious History'
...

David Armitage and Jo Guldi have written an article forthcoming in
*Annales* which will likely appear on many history department syllabi
this fall. (It ought to appear on religious studies syllabi too.) In
"[The Return of the *Longue Durée*: An Anglo-American Perspective][]",
Armitage and Guldi describe how and why historians since the 1920s
increasingly framed their work within shorter and shorter periods of
time. (In addition to their own reading of the historiography, they draw
on Ben Schmidt's [study of history dissertations][].) But Armitage and
Guldi also point out that since the 1980s historians have been more and
more likely to write about longer periods of time. And they argue that
"a return to ... the *longue durée* is now both imperative and feasible:
imperative, in order to restore history’s place as a critical social
science, and feasible due to the increased availability of large amount
of historical data and the digital tools necessary to analyse it."

The pattern that Armitage and Guldi point out for the writing of history
in general is one that I think also holds for American religious
history. Though it follows the same pattern in its relationship to the
*longue durée*, the field of American religion lagged several decades
behind the history profession as a whole. In this post, I want to make a
case for what I see as the broad pattern of historiography in American
religious history, then for why scholars of religion ought to heed
Armitage and Guldi's call for a return to the *longue durée*.

1972 for Ahlstrom.

This is an impressive grasp of the historiography of of many social,
political, intellectual. I want to extend their treatment to ask about
American religious history. What I also see missing from American
religious history is not just the longue duree, but a decline in the
synthesis. (By synthesis I don't really mean the synthesis that is aimed
at class rooms, but the kind of "primary synthesis" to borrow a phrase,
that is genuinely original scholarship but that aims its sights at a
broader level than the monograph.)

Sydney Ahlstrom's book is the touchstone to which I continually return.

I'm only going to mention good books, in these categories.

Let me mention longuee duree books, of an older period.

Conkin's American Originals, if not properly a longuee duree book . The
granddaddy of longuee duree books is Sydney Ahlstrom's Religious History
of the American Book. (For me this book represents a turning point, not
just because I like to think of Ahlstrom [who died the year that I was
born] as by Doktorgrossvatar, because it represents both an attempt to
synthesize everything and the apparent judgment of American religious
historians that such a synthesis could not be completed.)

Cultural histories got shorter. (Again, I'm only mentioning books that I
love.) Paul Johnson's A Shopkeeper's Millennium () looked at a few
years.

We could look at some of the best books being published. Kevin Schultz's
Tri-Faith America has an short period, as to a lesser extent, .

Is there anything in American religious history that can be said to be
the longue duree?

I say its in reach for digital reasons. And for reasons that we have
have accomplished so much on the micro and denominational.

Kambiz GhaneaBassiri's Islam in America, Jonathan Sarna's American
Judaism, Jim O'Toole's The Faithful, Cathy Albanese's Republic of Mind
and Spirit. Now there is definitely a career element here: for the most
part these are sweeping books by scholars at the height, not the
beginning of their careers. We could add to this cultural histories.
Histories of Jesus have long been popular, and Paul Harvey and Ed Blum's
recent *Color of Christ* has gained a lot of attention in part because
it tries to synthesize the history of race across several religious
traditions, but also because it does so over the full sweep of American
religious history (and where that attention is critical, it's because of
the longuee duree element). American Christianities, by Gilip and {FACT}
also has a longish period, though it is comprised of a number of shorter
elements.

Andrew Prestons's Sword of the Spirit, Shield of Faith. Lutheran guy's
book on violence.

This is part of a larger need, which I've been arguing for a long time,
that what American religious history needs is synthesis. That's a topic
perhaps I'll have to return to in a another statement. Briefly put, I
think there are so many different kinds of religion that get treated on
their own, and these must be brought together as historians have been
calling for since the 1997s books.

I think that religion is particularly suited to the longue duree
approach because the topic matter is less inherently bound to states,
and because the change of pace can be slower. In my case, I don't know
how the progress of time could be any shorter, given that tracing out
one life, let alone hundreds, consumes many decades.

That's why American religious history too often lapses into a
simplisitic argument that American religion was "diverse," with no
meaningful attempt at figuring out was central and peripheral. While I'm
extraordinarily grateful for the history that has been written from the
margins. Still history which has no argument but diversity seems
fundamentally an exercise in recovering denominational traditions rather
than an exercise in history, when by history I mean the inquiry into the
structures and changes in events.

Part of this is the experience of graduate students who either borrow
from or are dependent on history departments and broader intellectual
trends.

Part of this is inertia on the part of the profession: graduate students
and early career scholars are the most conservative, despite the fact
that that's the only way to guarantee that you're invisible to job
committees. Failure to pick up on digital methodologies. \*\*

What I think what we have is a failure of nerve by graduate students and
early career scholars. Who have been writing dissertations on how four
theologians read the bible then shortening it to three.

Since this is a somewhat tendentious critique of the state of the field,
I should mention that my dissertation, which tries to incorporate
Protestant, Native American, African American, Jewish, and Catholic ,
and irreligious history into one, and which runs from the American
revolution to the publication of William James's *Varieties of Religious
Experience* in 1902.

I think that

Now that I've argued about where I think the field is. Gentle readers,
do you detect the same change in American religious history from longuee
duree to short duree back to the longue duree? What great work do you
see moving in the field?

\*\* In the long run, though, I think that it will be people who can
combine the archive with broad reading who are going to do best.

"As we shall see, a generation with limited prospects on the job market
increasingly defined itself by its mastery of discrete archives." My
sense as well. Now we need scholars who can demonstrate mastery over a
wide swathe of material.

(I'd rather historians didn't use Wordle, but the point still stands.)

As I mentioned before, I think that this is tied to synthesis. And the
place of synthesis in American religious history is something I'll have
to turn to in a later post. But I write this post as a question more
than as an answer: has the chronological ambition of Am Rel Hist
shortened? And if so, is a return to longer scopes desirable and how
might it be possible?
