I am pleased---and grateful---to say that this fall I'll be joining the
[Department of History and Art History][] at George Mason University as
an assistant professor. I'll be teaching half my classes on digital
history and half on American religious history. In the fall I'll teach
an undergraduate course on church and state in America and a graduate
course on [computer programming for historians][]. Over the past few
years I've been able to get to know some of the people in the department
and at the [Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media][], and
there are many more great people whom I met during my visit and am
looking forward to getting to know. I feel fortunate to be joining them
as a colleague.
