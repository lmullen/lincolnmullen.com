title: The Two Purposes of Book Reviews
---

At the *Anxious Bench*, [Thomas Kidd][] has a post titled "[The Art of
the Book Review][]." Kidd argues:

> When reviewing a book, be as charitable as possible. This is a "Golden
> Rule" issue. Once you've experienced the years of struggle behind
> producing a book, you should be cautious about casually dismissing the
> value of another author's work. Even when I have major problems with a
> book, I try to praise it as much as I can, and include a few lines
> that a press could likely use to promote the book. ...
>
> It is certainly in-bounds to disagree with an author's interpretation

> a means of discussion rather than denunciation.

I'd add that there are two kinds of book reviews: reviews that appear in
professional, "serious" journals, and reviews that appear everywhere
else. These reviews have entirely different purposes. When I get my copy
of the *American Historical Review* or *Church History*, I browse the
reviews for anything that is immediately interesting or relevant. But
most of the time I come across reviews in journals like those through a
search in JSTOR or some other database. In such cases I'm looking for
reviews to find out the scholarly consensus about the worth of the book
that has been established over time. And make no mistake, it takes
time---years---for books to be reviewed in scholarly journals. I want
those reviews to be the plainest possible explanation of what is good
and bad about a book, perhaps even erring on the side of letting readers
know where they could be mislead.

But plenty of reviews are published on blogs like *[Religion in American
History][]*, *[The Anxious Bench][]*, and the *[S-USIH][]* blog, as well
as in general interest publications like magazines and newspapers. These
reviews can be of the highest quality---for example, take Paul Putz's
recent [review][] of Matthew Bowman's *The Urban Pulpit*. But the
purpose of these reviews is different. To [borrow a phrase from Dan
Cohen][], their purpose is "catching the good." When I read a review at
one of these sites, I want the authors to alert me to the best books,
books they've found useful for their research or teaching, or books that
are a [model of the historian's craft][]. I can't think of a reason why
someone would publish a highly critical review in venues like those,
especially since you get to pick what you review. If it's a bad book,
don't bother reviewing it.

If you agree to write a review for a scholarly journal, then be as
critical as you must, keeping in mind what Kidd [writes][The Art of the
Book Review] about charity and generosity. But if you are writing a
review for any other venue, find a book that's good, and tell people
about it.
