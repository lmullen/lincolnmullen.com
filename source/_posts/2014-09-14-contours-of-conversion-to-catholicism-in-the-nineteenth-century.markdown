title: Contours of Conversion to Catholicism in the Nineteenth Century
...

I have an article in the most recent issue of the *U.S. Catholic
Historian* titled "[The Contours of Conversion to Catholicism in the
Nineteenth Century][]" (paywalled at Project Muse, but [PDF here][]).
One of the things I like about that journal is their theme issues, and
this [issue][] has a nice lineup from [Erin Bartram][] on Jane Minot
Sedgwick II, [Stephanie A. T. Jacobe][] on Thomas Fortune Ryan, [Charles
Gallagher][] on Jacques Maritain, [Tim Lacy][] on Mortimer Adler, and
[Justin Poché][] on John Howard Griffin.

My article has some maps and charts of Paulists missions, which I've
made [dynamic here][]. The abstract:

> The chronological and theological contours of conversion to
> Catholicism in the nineteenth-century United States evidence three
> waves. Beginning with John Thayer’s 1783 conversion from
> Congregationalism and continuing through the 1830s, conversions were
> scattered, and often from Reformed Protestantism. The 1840s through
> 1860s, the critical period for Catholic conversion, included converts
> from American Episcopalianism, riven by the Oxford movement, and from
> Transcendentalist and liberal Christian reformers dissatisfied with
> reform’s theological underpinnings. These converts became the agents
> of a new movement to convert Protestants. From 1870 through the early
> twentieth century, missionary priests, especially members of the
> Missionary Society of St. Paul the Apostle (Paulists), won thousands
> of converts, making conversion to Catholicism a viable choice for many
> more Americans.
