title: 'CShapes: Historical Country Boundaries for R'
...

Nils Weidmann has put together [cshapes][], a useful package for R that
gives you country boundaries and capitals for the years 1946 to 2008.
This package is based on his cshapes [shapefile][]. (Via [Elijah
Meeks][].)

This is a nice model for packaging historical geographic information for
R. I'm hoping to do something similar for the Newberry Library's [Atlas
of Historical County Boundaries][].
