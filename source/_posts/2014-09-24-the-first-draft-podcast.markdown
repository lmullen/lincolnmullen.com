title: The First Draft Podcast
...

[The First Draft][] is relatively new in the small world of digital
humanities podcasts. It's hosted by some of my favorite DH people:
[Elijah Meeks][], [Jason Heppler][], and [Paul Zenke][]. I haven't made
it through the entire back catalog, but I've enjoyed their
[close-to-the-metal][] discussions of building in the digital
humanities. With their most recent episode titled "Tableau is Excel for
2014," it seems like they are trolling me personally.
