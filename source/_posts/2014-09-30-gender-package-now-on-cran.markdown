title: Gender package now on CRAN
...

[Gender][] is an R package which takes names and associated dates or
ranges of dates and predicts the gender of the name. The gender package
is [now on CRAN][Gender] for the first time; you can also see the
package [README at GitHub][]. This is the package description:

> Encodes gender based on names and dates of birth, using either the
> Social Security Administration's data set of first names by year of
> birth or Census Bureau data from 1789 to 1940, both from the United
> States of America. By using these data sets instead of lists of male
> and female names, this package is able to more accurately guess the
> gender of a name, and it is able to report the probability that a name
> was male or female.

The package was based on an idea by [Cameron Blevins][] and includes
contributions from [Ben Schmidt][].
