title: Visualizing RRCHNM Projects and People
...

This weekend I'm attending the [20th anniversary conference][] for the
Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media. In the honorable
tradition of spending time at DH conferences to build projects, a team
of people from the center (including students in my [Programming for
Historians Class][]) built a [visualization of the many people who have
worked at RRCHNM and the projects that they worked on][]. The data was
drawn from the [exhibit of the Center's work and people][] created for
the anniversary. Considering that in one day the collaborators
conceptualized the project, gathered the data from the API, cleaned the
data, visualized it, wrote up some explanatory text, and published a
website, I think it was a good day's work.
