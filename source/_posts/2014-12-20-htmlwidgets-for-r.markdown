title: htmlwidgets Package for R
...

Ramnath Vaidyanathan, Kenton Russell, and the very clever people at
RStudio have [released][] the [htmlwidgets][] package for R. The package
is "a framework that seamlessly bridges R and JavaScript." It provides a
way to integrate JavaScript libraries, especially for visualization,
into R packages. This is intended to make it easy to include dynamic
visualizations in Knitr documents or even in the R Console. Eventually
I'd like to develop an R package to do this for [Elijah Meek][]'s
excellent [d3-carto-map][].
