The graduate students in my fall 2014 class "[Programming for Historians](http://lincolnmullen.com/courses/clio3.2014/)"---Sara Collini, Peter Carr Jones, Jannelle Legg, Anne Ladyem McDivitt, George D. Oberle III, and Amanda Regan---and I will present the poster below at [2015 annual meeting](https://aha.confex.com/aha/2015/webprogram/Paper17312.html) of the American Historical Association. This post is a (more or less) permanent version of the poster along with supplementary materials.

Finally, two other links may be of use. The first is the [syllabus for 
the course](http://lincolnmullen.com/courses/clio3.2014/). The second is the ongoing draft of *[Digital History Methods in R](http://dh-r.lincolnmullen.com/)*, a book that I began writing during the semester to use as course materials.
