title: Roundup of Syllabi from the Fall Semester
...

*[This post was originally published at [Religion in American History]().]*

Happy New Year, Religion in American History readers.

One of my favorite ways to get to know a scholar is to read her syllabi.
Syllabi show how scholars put together a whole field. (And probably no
text reveals personality as much as the introduction and policies on a
syllabus.) Yet unfortunately teaching documents are shared less
routinely than our research, so we are much more likely to know a
scholar's books and articles than her syllabi. Following the example of
Paul Putz's regular lists of new books, I intend to start a posting a
roundup of syllabi for religious history and religious studies from the
past semester from whoever wishes to contribute.

So here is a list of past syllabi from people who replied to my
entreaties. Only a small number replied this first time, but if you
would like to add your syllabus to this list, feel free to leave a link
in the comments, or you can e-mail me a document and I'll add it
(`lincoln@lincolnmullen.com`).
