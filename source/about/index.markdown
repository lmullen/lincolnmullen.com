I am a [PhD student in American history][] at [Brandeis University][] in
[Waltham, Massachusetts][]. I study American religious history, as well
as American history in the colonial and antebellum eras. For full
academic information, see my [curriculum vitae][] (PDF). You can write
to me at `lincoln@lincolnmullen.com`.

My academic work is primarily on my dissertation, a history of religious
conversion and of people crossing religious boundaries in the United
States during the nineteenth century. The working title of the
dissertation is *The Varieties of American Conversion: The Origins of
Religious Choice in the United States*. Citations and in most cases the
full text of my [academic publications][] are available on this site.
This page lists articles, book reviews, and talks.

This site hosts [a blog][] on history, religion, and the digital
humanities. I contribute regularly to [ProfHacker][], a blog published
by the [*Chronicle of Higher Education*][]. A list of my posts can be
found [on the ProfHacker site][]. I helped organize the [2010][] and
[2011][] meetings of [THATCamp New England][]. I'm also the web editor
for the [*Journal of Southern Religion*][].
