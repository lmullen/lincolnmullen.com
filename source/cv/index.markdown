### Full Text of Publications

*N.B. Below is a list of publications and talks which I can make
available here, either because I have the rights or because I don't have
specific plans for a derivative version of talks. I am always willing to
share the text of talks even if they are not listed here. For a full
list of publications and talks, please [see the CV][Download this CV as
a PDF]. Almost everything that I can put online is also published or
linked to in a [blog post][].*
