### How should I format my paper/citations?

Follow the most recent edition of the *[Chicago Manual of Style](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0226104206/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0226104206&linkCode=as2&tag=thebacgla-20&linkId=VGU4CJLFQSD2Z4ZS)*. Note that the electronic edition, which you can [access through the Mason libraries](http://magik.gmu.edu/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?BBID=1965471), is more convenient than the print edition. Chicago offers two documentation styles; use the notes and bibliography system (ch. 14).

### Can you recommend any good books on writing?

One book on writing is in a class by itself. Joseph Williams and Gregory
G. Colomb's *Style: Lessons in Clarity and Grace* (any [edition will
do](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321898680/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0321898680&linkCode=as2&tag=thebacgla-20&linkId=7UR2DFH6ZKUX47ND))
offers concrete explanations of what makes for good and bad writing. 

*[The Elements of
Style](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/020530902X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=020530902X&linkCode=as2&tag=thebacgla-20&linkId=TNVXJPB2NKQH4SRC)*
by William Strunk Jr. and E. B. White is a classic. William Zinsser's *[On
Writing
Well](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060891548/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0060891548&linkCode=as2&tag=thebacgla-20&linkId=OQC2OZ6SVX6TO2OW)*
is on writing as a whole. For specifics of writing in history, Mary Lynn
Rampolla's *[A Pocket Guide to Writing in
History](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312610416/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0312610416&linkCode=as2&tag=thebacgla-20&linkId=V5LHKEGSHRAGUKU5)*
is helpful.

### What verb tense should I use?

Historians write in the [simple past
tense](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_past). Historical events
happened in the past, so we write about them in the past tense.

> ~~Frederick Douglass escapes from slavery in 1838.~~\
> ~~Frederick Douglass was escaping from slavery in 1838.~~\
> ~~Frederick Douglass would escape from slavery in 1838.~~\
> ~~Frederick Douglass would be escaping from slavery in 1838.~~\
> ~~Frederick Douglass has escaped from slavery in 1838.~~

> Frederick Douglass escaped from slavery in 1838.

When you need to express antecedent action, use the [past
perfect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluperfect) (or
[pluperfect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluperfect)) tense.

> Frederick Douglass, who had escaped from slavery in 1838, delivered
> his address "What to the Slave Is the Fourth of July" in 1852.

You may use the historical present tense once you have won the Bancroft
or Pulitzer Prize.
