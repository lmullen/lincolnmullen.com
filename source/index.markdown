Greetings. I am a PhD candidate in the [history department][] at
[Brandeis University][] and a historian of religion in early America and
the nineteenth century.

My [dissertation][] is a history of conversion between religions in the
nineteenth-century United States. My [curriculum vitae][] has my
publications, talks, and workshops, usually in full text. My
[research][] is made public in databases and other digital projects.
Along with Erin Bartram, I've created the [American Converts
Database][], and I'm working on a project on the [historical
demographics of American religion][]. I [teach classes][] on American
religious history, the nineteenth century, and digital humanities. I'm a
regular contributor at at [Religion in American History][] and
[ProfHacker][].

On this site I write an academic blog about history, religion, and
digital humanities, which also aggregates my writings elsewhere. Here is
a list of [all of my posts][], and these are the most recent:
