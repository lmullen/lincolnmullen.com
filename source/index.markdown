I am a [PhD student in American history](http://www.brandeis.edu/departments/history/) at [Brandeis University](http://www.brandeis.edu/) in [Waltham, Massachusetts](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Brandeis+University+415+South+St+Waltham,+MA+02453-2700&sll=42.365774,-71.256766&sspn=0.016488,0.028968&ie=UTF8&ll=42.367708,-71.255822&spn=0.016488,0.028968&z=15). I study American religious history, as well as American history in the colonial and antebellum eras. For full academic information, see my [curriculum vitae]({{ root_url }}/docs/Mullen-cv.pdf) (PDF).

My academic work is primarily on my dissertation, a history of religious conversion and of people crossing religious boundaries in the United States during the nineteenth century. The working title of the dissertation is *The Varieties of American Conversion: The Origins of Religious Choice in the United States*.
