title: Analyzing Historical History Dissertations
---

Starting in February 2014, I have been writing a series of posts
analyzing a data set of historical dissertations about history, derived
from the [ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Database][]. (Thanks,
ProQuest.) Below is an up-to-date list of all the posts in this series.
If you would like to link to or cite this work in progress, you might
wish to use this page, since sometimes later posts correct analysis in
earlier posts.
