### Dissertation

*The Varieties of Religious Conversion: The Origins of Religious Choice
in the United States*, Brandeis University (expected 2014)

<div class="abstract">

In the nineteenth-century United States, people converted between
religions often, and often faced the opportunity to convert. As
conversions became ubiquitous, they changed the meaning of religious
identity for everyone, because the explicit choices of converts forced
an implicit choice on all. Religion became less an identity to be
inherited or ascribed and more a choice that had to be warranted to
oneself and justified to others. This dissertation is a history of how
that idea developed and was refracted through conversions to several
religions. It begins after the Revolution with Hannah Adams's
*Alphabetical Compendium of the Various Sects* (1784), an Enlightenment
text grappling with the problem world religions caused for Christian
claims, and ends with William James's *Varieties of Religious
Experience* (1902), an American psychological study of conversion and
the self that comprised part of James's pragmatic theory of truth.

An introduction discusses how legal, political, and economic structures
in the early republic created a voluntary religious system where the
state did not support religion but guaranteed the right to persuade.
Protestants, the subject of chapter 1, regained ground lost in
disestablishment as they flooded the market with evangelistic tracts
funded by both gift and purchase. By the 1830s--40s, as evangelicals
developed new theologies in response to revivals and mobilized those
ideas in tracts, evangelical Protestants experienced a new kind of
conversion ritual. This "sinner's prayer" emphasized individual choice
and made conversions more punctual, more immediate. Chapter 2 follows
Protestant missionary organizations to the Southeast, where they
missionized the Cherokee and other Native American nations. Cherokee
converts translated Christianity into their own language and terms.
Cherokees often had no choice but to join the economic market brought by
missionaries and settlers, but they accepted Christianity in the terms
of a gift, or grace, economy. Chapter 3 turns to the experiences of
slaves and freedmen and -women before and after the Civil War, comparing
how African Americans, bonded and free, came to Christianity or held
fast to Islam or animist religions.

Chapter 4 discusses conversion to and from Judaism, a small minority
faith, while chapter 5 takes up conversions to Catholicism, by century's
end the largest religious denomination. Though evangelized more than any
other group, Jews argued that Christians were literally buying converts
and thus called into doubt whether any conversion from Judaism to
Christianity could be sincere. At the same time Judaism won converts
from Christianity, a fact that Jews mustered to prove that they could
compete with Christianity given the protection of law and fair play
within the denominational system. Though some Americans found the
competitions of religious sects to be an aid to finding truth, thousands
of converts rejected the babel of sects to become Catholics. Because
Catholicism recognized the validity of Protestant baptisms, new
Catholics experienced conversion as a return from heresy to the unity of
the church.

Freethinkers, skeptics, and atheists found the multiplicity of religions
a reason to abandon religion altogether, yet their presence, both real
and imagined, persuaded Americans of the need to convert and be
converted. The conclusion argues that infidelity removed the possibility
that religious could be default. Because of conversions between
religions, the United States became a place where everyone experienced
religion as a Jamesian "forced, living, and momentous" choice. This
dissertation thus argues that a variety of religions and a constellation
of ideas---punctuality, the gift, freedom, sincerity, catholicity,
infidelity---shaped the American idea of religion.
