### Dissertation

*The Varieties of Religious Conversion: The Origins of Religious Choice
in the United States*, Brandeis University (August 2014).

<div class="abstract">

In the nineteenth-century United States, thousands of people converted
between religions, and many more faced the opportunity to convert. As
conversions became ubiquitous, they changed the meaning of religious
identity for everyone, because the explicit choices of converts forced
an implicit choice on all. Religion became less an identity to be
inherited and more a choice that had to be warranted to oneself and
justified to others. In the 1830s--40s, evangelical Protestants
developed new theologies in response to revivals and mobilized those
ideas in tracts. They created a new kind of conversion ritual, a
"sinner's prayer" which emphasized individual choice and made
conversions more immediate. Protestants extended this kind of conversion
in missions to the Cherokee and other Indian nations, yet Cherokee
converts translated Christianity into their own language and accepted
Christianity in the terms of a gift economy. Slaves and freedpeople
developed their own form of conversion, based on eschatological passages
from the Bible and crafted in contrast to slaveowners' Christianity.
Though evangelized more than any other group, Jews argued that
Christians were literally buying converts and thus called into doubt
whether any conversion from Judaism to Christianity could be sincere.
Judaism also won converts from Christianity, proving to potential
converts that Judaism could compete with Christianity within the
denominational system. Competition between religious sects provoked
thousands of converts to reject denominationalism and become Catholic.
Because Catholicism recognized the validity of Protestant baptisms, new
Catholics experienced conversion as a return from heresy to the unity of
the church. Freethinkers, skeptics, and atheists found the multiplicity
of religions a reason to abandon religion altogether, yet their
presence, both real and imagined, persuaded other Americans of the need
to convert and be converted. Infidelity removed the possibility that a
religious identity could be a default. Because of conversions between
religions, the United States became a place where everyone experienced
religion as what William James called a "forced, living, and momentous"
choice.

### Paulists Missions, 1851--1906

The Paulist Fathers are a Catholic order founded in the United States in
1858. Their apostolate is the conversion of Americans to Roman
Catholicism. Beginning with their missions as Redemptorist priests in
1851, the Paulists kept records of the missions that they held, the
number of converts they made, and the number of confessions they heard
(which is roughly a count of the number of people who attended the
missions). This map with accompanying charts demonstrates the spread of
Catholic missions and conversions across the United States.
