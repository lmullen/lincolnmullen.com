### Religion and Capitalism in the U.S.

[Syllabus](http://lincolnmullen.com/courses/religion-capitalism.2015/) | [Course blog](http://lincolnmullen.com/course-blogs/religion-capitalism-2015/) | George Mason University, spring 2015

<div class="abstract">

The relationship between religion and capitalism has long puzzled historians of the United States, and before them it vexed the people whom historians study. In this class, you will meet many people whose religion led them to interact with capitalism in incredibly diverse ways. You will meet the Puritans whose work ethic supposedly created capitalism, but who insisted on resting on the Sabbath; Moravian missionaries who made converts and money; slaves, slaveowners, and abolitionists who all claimed the Bible when reckoning with the capitalist system of slavery; a Protestant writer who insisted that Jesus was a businessman, and Catholics who believed Jesus called them to a kind of socialism; African American preachers who marketed their recorded sermons; Jews who mass-manufactured matzah and created Yiddish socialism; an industrialist who wrote *The Gospel of Wealth*, and laborers who created churches for the working class; nineteenth-century consumers who turned gift-giving into a ritual, and a twenty-first-century television personality who turned consumption into therapy; converts who thought religion required poverty, and Prosperity Gospelers who thought it promised wealth. You will read primary sources from American history, secondary works in both religious history and the new history of capitalism, and excerpts from theorists of religion and capitalism. Through these readings and your own research project, you are invited make sense of this perpetual historical puzzle.

### The Digital Past

George Mason University, spring 2015

<div class="abstract">

In this class, you will to learn to do history using digital tools. The
course---which satisfies the university's IT requirement---teaches the
fundamentals of information technology by applying them to a practical
problem in history. Throughout the semester, you will work individually
and with classmates on a research project about American religious
history. You will learn how to do research online, but also how to put
those sources in the context of other scholarly work. You will gather
data, learn how to question it, analyze it, summarize it, and interpret
it. You will create visualizations of datasets, especially maps. But you
will also learn how to integrate data with narratives from individual
lives. You will learn how to present visual and textual sources online
in web exhibits, and you will learn how to write and publish effectively
online. Through learning by doing, you will gain many digital skills
which are broadly applicable; even more important, you will learn how to
use these skills to create arguments and stories. This combination will
be useful to you throughout your university career and in your
professional life.

### Programming in History/New Media

[Syllabus and course website][] | George Mason University, fall 2014

<div class="abstract">

This class will introduce you to the rudiments of programming languages;
even more, the class will teach you how to learn how to learn whatever
programming techniques you need to solve scholarly problems. We will
spend the first month on a general introduction to programming. Most of
the course will focus on applying programming techniques to historical
research. Each week you will learn a new technique—such as a
visualization, mapping, network analysis, text-mining—using real
historical data to develop arguments and interpretation. By the end of
the semester you will create a programming project of your choice which
will help you in your future scholarly research. The main languages that
you will learn are JavaScript (a language obligatory for the web but
useful for many applications) and R (a statistical programming language
well-suited to scholarly purposes), but you are encouraged to learn any
language you like for the final project.

### Church and State in America

[Syllabus and course website][1] | George Mason University, fall 2014

<div class="abstract">

Two of the most pressing questions about American religion and its
public role are intertwined: how should religions relate to one another,
and how should religions relate to the state? In this class you will
take up these questions by studying the interactions of Protestant,
Catholic, Jewish, Mormon, and Native American religions with one another
and with the federal and state governments. You will investigate how law
has regulated the public sphere and the civil square in which religious
interactions take place, but also how religious actors have driven those
interactions. We will read primary and secondary sources about the
American Revolution and disestablishment, moral reform, temperance, and
abolition, polygamy, the school system, pacifism, civil rights, and
political movements, ranging from the late eighteenth to the late
twentieth century.

### Mapping Boston's Religions: A Digital History Seminar

<a href="/files/religion-19c-dh.pdf" onclick="ga('send', 'event', { 
'eventCategory': 'PDF', 'eventAction': 'Download', 'eventLabel': 
'religion-19c-dh.pdf', 'page': '/files/religion-19c-dh.pdf' 
});">Syllabus</a> | [Course Project][] | Brandeis University, spring
2014

<div class="abstract">

In this course you will read the writings of the many individuals and
groups that lived out their religion in the nineteenth-century United
States: the alliance of skeptics and believers who supported
disestablishment; Baptist and Methodists revivalists; Catholic priests,
missionaries, and animists; founders of new religions such as Mormonism
and Christian Science; Reform and Orthodox Jews; African-Americans;
metaphysicians; liberal and conservative Protestants; agnostics and
atheists. We will make sense of that diversity by asking and answering a
set of unifying questions: How did mainstream and minority faiths relate
to one another, especially in the public sphere? How did people
experience religion in their everyday lives? How did religious people
change laws and society? How did new forms of religious expression
develop? How were new religions founded? How were religions imported
from Europe, Asia, Africa, and South America, and how did those
religions adapt? How did Americans become more religious and more
secular at the same time? The centerpiece of this class will be a
digital history project: you will do your own original research into
nineteenth-century sources to make a digital map of religion in Boston
over the nineteenth century. Creating this project will teach you the
skills of a historian---researching, writing, analyzing---and will let
you put what you'll learn in this class to work on the ground. In this
history class as shop class, you'll also learn digital and project
skills---publishing, mapping, encoding, collaborating, communicating,
managing---that are widely useful in government, business, and research
outside the academy.

### Religious Pluralism and the American State

'Download', 'eventLabel': 'religious-pluralism.syllabus.2012-fall.pdf', 
'page': '/files/religious-pluralism.syllabus.2012-fall.pdf' 
});">Syllabus</a> | Brandeis University, fall 2012

<div class="abstract">

Two of the most pressing questions about American religion and its
public role are intertwined: how should religions relate to one another,
and how should religions relate to the state? In this class you will
take up these two questions through the historical analysis of texts
about the interactions of Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, Mormon, and
Native American religions with one another and with the federal and
state governments. You will investigate how law has regulated the public
sphere and the civil square in which religious interactions take place,
but also how religious actors have driven those interactions. We will
trace the history of American pluralism, from the fact of diversity in
eighteenth century to the idea of pluralism in the twenty-first century.
Because this is a writing seminar, you will write three essays: one
expositing a document about a religious conflict, a second interacting
with other historians' interpretations, and a third based on original
research into religious conflict.
