### The Digital Past

George Mason University, spring 2015

<div class="abstract">

In this class, you will to learn to do history using digital tools. The
course---which satisfies the university's IT requirement---teaches the
fundamentals of information technology within the context of a history
course rather than as a set of abstract principles or discrete skills
tied to particular software packages. The content focus for the course
will be the history of American religions, but the skills you learn over
the semester will be useful to you throughout your university career and
in your professional life. In our Active Learning Environment, you will
work with your classmates to locate and analyze digitized historical
primary sources; research and synthesize secondary sources to offer
context for your primary source work; publish your work online using
content management systems; gather and refine data from many sources to
produce effective visualizations; create digital maps that offer a
spatial context for your primary sources; analyze and interpret large
corpora of texts; and, combine all of these skills together to ask and
answer an historical inquiry question. Above all, this is a course about
learning by doing.

### Programming in History/New Media

[Syllabus and course website][] | George Mason University, fall 2014

<div class="abstract">

This class will introduce you to the rudiments of programming languages;
even more, the class will teach you how to learn how to learn whatever
programming techniques you need to solve scholarly problems. We will
spend the first month on a general introduction to programming. Most of
the course will focus on applying programming techniques to historical
research. Each week you will learn a new technique—such as a
visualization, mapping, network analysis, text-mining—using real
historical data to develop arguments and interpretation. By the end of
the semester you will create a programming project of your choice which
will help you in your future scholarly research. The main languages that
you will learn are JavaScript (a language obligatory for the web but
useful for many applications) and R (a statistical programming language
well-suited to scholarly purposes), but you are encouraged to learn any
language you like for the final project.

### Church and State in America

[Syllabus and course website][1] | George Mason University, fall 2014

<div class="abstract">

Two of the most pressing questions about American religion and its
public role are intertwined: how should religions relate to one another,
and how should religions relate to the state? In this class you will
take up these questions by studying the interactions of Protestant,
Catholic, Jewish, Mormon, and Native American religions with one another
and with the federal and state governments. You will investigate how law
has regulated the public sphere and the civil square in which religious
interactions take place, but also how religious actors have driven those
interactions. We will read primary and secondary sources about the
American Revolution and disestablishment, moral reform, temperance, and
abolition, polygamy, the school system, pacifism, civil rights, and
political movements, ranging from the late eighteenth to the late
twentieth century.

### Mapping Boston's Religions: A Digital History Seminar

'eventCategory': 'PDF', 'eventAction': 'Download', 'eventLabel': 
'religion-19c-dh.pdf', 'page': '/files/religion-19c-dh.pdf' 
});">Syllabus</a> | [Course Project][] | Brandeis University, spring
2014

<div class="abstract">

In this course you will read the writings of the many individuals and
groups that lived out their religion in the nineteenth-century United
States: the alliance of skeptics and believers who supported
disestablishment; Baptist and Methodists revivalists; Catholic priests,
missionaries, and animists; founders of new religions such as Mormonism
and Christian Science; Reform and Orthodox Jews; African-Americans;
metaphysicians; liberal and conservative Protestants; agnostics and
atheists. We will make sense of that diversity by asking and answering a
set of unifying questions: How did mainstream and minority faiths relate
to one another, especially in the public sphere? How did people
experience religion in their everyday lives? How did religious people
change laws and society? How did new forms of religious expression
develop? How were new religions founded? How were religions imported
from Europe, Asia, Africa, and South America, and how did those
religions adapt? How did Americans become more religious and more
secular at the same time? The centerpiece of this class will be a
digital history project: you will do your own original research into
nineteenth-century sources to make a digital map of religion in Boston
over the nineteenth century. Creating this project will teach you the
skills of a historian---researching, writing, analyzing---and will let
you put what you'll learn in this class to work on the ground. In this
history class as shop class, you'll also learn digital and project
skills---publishing, mapping, encoding, collaborating, communicating,
managing---that are widely useful in government, business, and research
outside the academy.

### Religious Pluralism and the American State

<a href="/files/religious-pluralism.syllabus.2012-fall.pdf"

'Download', 'eventLabel': 'religious-pluralism.syllabus.2012-fall.pdf', 
'page': '/files/religious-pluralism.syllabus.2012-fall.pdf' 
});">Syllabus</a> | Brandeis University, fall 2012

<div class="abstract">

Two of the most pressing questions about American religion and its
public role are intertwined: how should religions relate to one another,
and how should religions relate to the state? In this class you will
take up these two questions through the historical analysis of texts
about the interactions of Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, Mormon, and
Native American religions with one another and with the federal and
state governments. You will investigate how law has regulated the public
sphere and the civil square in which religious interactions take place,
but also how religious actors have driven those interactions. We will
trace the history of American pluralism, from the fact of diversity in
eighteenth century to the idea of pluralism in the twenty-first century.
Because this is a writing seminar, you will write three essays: one
expositing a document about a religious conflict, a second interacting
with other historians' interpretations, and a third based on original
research into religious conflict.
