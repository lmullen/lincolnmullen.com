## [Nineteenth-Century American Religion: A Digital History Seminar][upi-syllabus]

*Brandeis University, University Prize Instructorship, scheduled spring 2014*

-   **[Syllabus][upi-syllabus]**   

**Course description:** During the American Revolution and the following 
decades, the state and federal governments cut their financial and 
constitutional support for established churches. Though many at the time 
predicted the demise of Christianity, the result was a flowering of an 
astonishing diversity of religions. In this course you will read the 
writings of the many individuals and groups that lived out their 
religion in the nineteenth-century United States: the alliance of 
skeptics and believers who supported disestablishment; Baptist and 
Methodists revivalists; Catholic priests, missionaries, and animists; 
founders of new religions such as Mormonism and Christian Science; 
Reform and Orthodox Jews; African-Americans; metaphysicians; liberal and 
conservative Protestants; agnostics and atheists. We will make sense of 
that diversity by asking and answering a set of unifying questions: How 
did mainstream and minority faiths relate to one another, especially in 
the public sphere?  How did people experience religion in their everyday 
lives? How did religious people change laws and society? How did new 
forms of religious expression develop? How were new religions founded? 
How were religions imported from Europe, Asia, Africa, and South 
America, and how did those religions adapt? How did Americans become 
more religious and more secular at the same time?

The centerpiece of this class will be a digital history project: you 
will do your own original research into nineteenth-century sources to 
make a digital map of religion in Boston over the nineteenth century.  
Creating this project will teach you the skills of a 
historian---researching, writing, analyzing---and will let you put what 
you'll learn in this class to work on the ground. In this history class 
as shop class, you'll also learn digital and project 
skills---publishing, mapping, encoding, collaborating, communicating, 
managing---that are widely useful in government, business, and research 
outside the academy.

## [Religious Pluralism and the American State][uws-website]

*Brandeis University, fall 2012*

-   **[Syllabus][uws-syllabus]**  
-   **[Course website][uws-website]**

**Course description:** Two of the most pressing questions about
American religion and its public role are intertwined: how should
religions relate to one another, and how should religions relate to the
state? In this class you will take up these two questions through the
historical analysis of texts about the interactions of Protestant,
Catholic, Jewish, Mormon, and Native American religions with one another
and with the federal and state governments. You will investigate how law
has regulated the public sphere and the civil square in which religious
interactions take place, but also how religious actors have driven those
interactions. We will trace the history of American pluralism, from the
fact of diversity in eighteenth century to the idea of pluralism in the
twenty-first century. Because this is a writing seminar, you will write
three essays: one expositing a document about a religious conflict, a
second interacting with other historians' interpretations, and a third
based on original research into religious conflict.

## The American Revolution (co-taught)
