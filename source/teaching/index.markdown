### Mapping Boston's Religions: A Digital History Seminar

[Syllabus][] | Brandeis University, spring 2014

<div class="abstract">

In this course you will read the writings of the many individuals and 
groups that lived out their religion in the nineteenth-century United 
States: the alliance of skeptics and believers who supported 
disestablishment; Baptist and Methodists revivalists; Catholic priests, 
missionaries, and animists; founders of new religions such as Mormonism 
and Christian Science; Reform and Orthodox Jews; African-Americans; 
metaphysicians; liberal and conservative Protestants; agnostics and 
atheists. We will make sense of that diversity by asking and answering a 
set of unifying questions: How did mainstream and minority faiths relate 
to one another, especially in the public sphere? How did people 
experience religion in their everyday lives? How did religious people 
change laws and society? How did new forms of religious expression 
develop? How were new religions founded?  How were religions imported 
from Europe, Asia, Africa, and South America, and how did those 
religions adapt? How did Americans become more religious and more 
secular at the same time? The centerpiece of this class will be a 
digital history project: you will do your own original research into 
nineteenth-century sources to make a digital map of religion in Boston 
over the nineteenth century.  Creating this project will teach you the 
skills of a historian---researching, writing, analyzing---and will let 
you put what you'll learn in this class to work on the ground. In this 
history class as shop class, you'll also learn digital and project 
skills---publishing, mapping, encoding, collaborating, communicating, 
managing---that are widely useful in government, business, and research 
outside the academy.

### Religious Pluralism and the American State

[Syllabus][1] | Brandeis University, fall 2012

<div class="abstract">

Two of the most pressing questions about American religion and its
public role are intertwined: how should religions relate to one another,
and how should religions relate to the state? In this class you will
take up these two questions through the historical analysis of texts
about the interactions of Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, Mormon, and
Native American religions with one another and with the federal and
state governments. You will investigate how law has regulated the public
sphere and the civil square in which religious interactions take place,
but also how religious actors have driven those interactions. We will
trace the history of American pluralism, from the fact of diversity in
eighteenth century to the idea of pluralism in the twenty-first century.
Because this is a writing seminar, you will write three essays: one
expositing a document about a religious conflict, a second interacting
with other historians' interpretations, and a third based on original
research into religious conflict.
