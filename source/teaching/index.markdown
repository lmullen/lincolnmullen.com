## [Religious Pluralism and the American State][uws]

*Brandeis University, fall 2012*

**[Syllabus][uws-syllabus]**   |   **[Course website][uws]**

**Course description:** Two of the most pressing questions about
American religion and its public role are intertwined: how should
religions relate to one another, and how should religions relate to the
state? In this class you will take up these two questions through the
historical analysis of texts about the interactions of Protestant,
Catholic, Jewish, Mormon, and Native American religions with one another
and with the federal and state governments. You will investigate how law
has regulated the public sphere and the civil square in which religious
interactions take place, but also how religious actors have driven those
interactions. We will trace the history of American pluralism, from the
fact of diversity in eighteenth century to the idea of pluralism in the
twenty-first century. Because this is a writing seminar, you will write
three essays: one expositing a document about a religious conflict, a
second interacting with other historians' interpretations, and a third
based on original research into religious conflict.
