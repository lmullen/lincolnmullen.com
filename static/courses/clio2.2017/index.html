  <h2 id="course-description">Course description</h2>
  <p>In this methods course you will be introduced to data analysis and visualization for historians. You will learn to
    work with historical data, including finding, gathering, manipulating, analyzing, visualizing, and arguing from
    data, with special attention to geospatial, textual, and network data. These methods will be taught primarily
    through scripting in the <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R programming language</a>, using other command line
    tools as appropriate. You will also learn how to present history on the web with HTML and CSS. While historical
    methods can be applied to many topics and time periods, they cannot be understood separate from how the discipline
    forms meaningful questions and interpretations, nor divorced from the particularities of the sources and histories
    of some specific topic. Therefore, in this course we will examine the historiographical tradition to see how
    historians have used data and visualization to understand the past. And we will work together to apply these methods
    to a series of datasets in the history of the nineteenth-century United States, with a focus on religion.</p>
  <p>After taking this course, you will be able to</p>
  <ul>
    <li>perform exploratory data analysis; clean, tidy, and manipulate data; gather historical data from print and
      manuscript sources; use existing historical data sets provided by government or other research groups; create
      common visualizations; work with geospatial, textual, and network data.</li>
    <li>write scripts using the R programming language and its extensive set of packages, as well as use command line
      programs.</li>
    <li>understand the place of data analysis and visualization within humanities computing, digital history, and the
      discipline of history.</li>
    <li>conceive of and execute a research project in computational history suitable for treatment in a dissertation
      chapter or journal article.</li>
    <li>take the course “Programming in History/New Media,” a.k.a. Clio 3, should you choose.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="essential-information">Essential information</h2>
  <p>You are always welcome to come to my office hours or to arrange an appointment. All other communication for this
    course will happen in <a href="https://mason-dh-grad.slack.com/signup">our Slack group</a>. Read this <a
      href="https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/218080037-Getting-started-for-new-users">getting started guide</a>
    if you need help.</p>
  <p>Please obtain copies of the following books. All other readings are available online or through the GMU libraries.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Isabel Meirelles, <em><a href="http://isabelmeirelles.com/book-design-for-information/">Design for Information:
          An Introduction to the Histories, Theories, and Best Practices Behind Effective Information
          Visualizations</a></em> (Rockport Publishers, 2013).</li>

          Nineteenth-Century America</a></em> (University of Chicago Press, 2012).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Bring a computer to each class meeting. You will need the following software.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>We will use <a href="https://cran.rstudio.com/">R</a> and <a
        href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#Desktop">RStudio</a>. <a
        href="http://dh-r.lincolnmullen.com/installing-r-and-packages.html">Install them</a> on your own computer. You
      will also have access to an <a href="http://rstudio.chnm.org/">RStudio Server instance</a> which will let you use
      R in your browser.</li>
    <li>Get a real text editor and CSV reader. <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> and <a
        href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a> seem to be popular choices. The one true text editor is <a
        href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a>, but it has a steep learning curve. Download <a
        href="https://www.libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice</a> or use Google Sheets because both do better than Excel at
      not messing with CSV files.</li>
    <li>Much of your work for the course will go on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>. Sign up for an account.
    </li>
    <li>If you do not already have a web host, I recommend <a
        href="https://portal.reclaimhosting.com/aff.php?aff=004">Reclaim Hosting</a>.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="assignments">Assignments</h2>
  <p>For any assignment, <strong>you are more than welcome to work on your own research topic,</strong> provided that
    you check with me first. Ideally your work in this course will advance your dissertation or other research project.
    Talk to me early in the course and we will figure out together what would work best for you. <strong>Please upload
      all assignments to <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/request/zEOUIFXPzVCbxURZP4x5">this Dropbox
        folder</a>.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Be prepared</strong>. Preparation and participation are expected as a matter of course in a graduate class.
    Complete all readings and assignments before class. If the readings include sample code or questions at the end,
    work through them as part of doing the readings. By noon on the day of class, please post a brief message to the
    course Slack group about one thing you learned and one thing you want to see better explained. I will use your
    messages to tailor my explanations in class.</p>
  <p><strong>Worksheets and weekly assignments (45%).</strong> Most classes will have an assignment due before class
    begins. Some will require you to do library research; others will be data analysis worksheets. The worksheets are
    for you to practice what we have gone over in class. They will also serve as a helpful reference sheet when you need
    to remember how to perform some kind of analysis. Some of the questions on the worksheet will be easy; most will be
    difficult; some you may find nearly impossible. The aim is to <em>practice</em>. We will go over the worksheets in
    class each week. Unless otherwise specified, ask for help in the Slack channel but try not to just give the answers
    away. Each student must turn in his or her own worksheet. If you attempt a problem and can’t solve it, you should
    still turn in whatever work you did on it. Here is how I will grade these worksheets. Each question will receive a 2
    for a correct answer correctly solved; a 1 for an incorrect answer with a good attempt at solving the problem; and
    otherwise a 0. I will multiply the score for the question by a number for the difficulty of the question, so that
    more difficult questions are worth more. I will total up your scores as we go, and grade them on a curve at the end
    of the semester. Students who complete all the easy and moderate difficulty questions, attempt the very difficult
    questions, and ask me for help as needed will do just fine.</p>
  <p><strong>Visualization essays (3 essays @ 15% each).</strong> You will write three brief visualization essays, each
    demonstrating a specific skill in data analysis. At a minimum these essays should include the following: (1)
    explanatory text written for a scholarly but non-technical audience that frames the visualizations in both
    historical and historiographical terms and argues some worthwhile point; (2) as many well-crafted visualizations or
    data tables as are necessary to argue that point; (3) access to the code through GitHub (though the code should not
    be visible in the essay itself) which can be successfully re-run by me; and (4) citations. These essays should be
    submitted as <a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/">R Markdown documents</a> via GitHub, each as its own
    repository. Ideally you will write these essays using some historical data of interest to you, but I will provide
    data if you don’t have any of your own. Students who wish to attempt some more ambitious project (which must still
    meet those requirements) are welcome to talk with me about combining two or three of the visualization essays into a
    single format.</p>
  <p><strong>Tutorial (10%).</strong> At our second meeting, you will pick from a list of analytical techniques, R
    packages, and other software not covered in this class. Beginning at week 6, you will be assigned a week to teach
    the class for 25 minutes about the topic you selected. As part of that teaching, you will prepare a handout with an
    explanation of why the package or method is useful, some suggested applications to history, and sample code and
    results. <a href="http://programminghistorian.org/">The Programming Historian</a> tutorials are a helpful model.
    Submit the human-readable form of the tutorial to the course Slack the day before class, so everyone can read it
    before class. Submit the GitHub repository with your handout to me.</p>

    <p>Students must satisfactorily complete all assignments (including participation assignments) in order to pass this
      course. Your attendance is expected at every meeting. If you must be absent, I request that you notify me in
      advance of the class meeting. I am sometimes willing to grant extensions for cause, but you must request an
      extension before the assignment’s due date. For every day or part of a day that an assignment is late without an
      extension, I may reduce your grade. No work (other than final exams and final projects) will be accepted later
      than the last day that the class meets unless I have agreed otherwise. I will discuss grades only in person during
      office hours.</p>
