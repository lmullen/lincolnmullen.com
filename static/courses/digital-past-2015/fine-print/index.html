  <h3 id="acknowledgments">Acknowledgments</h3>
<p>Versions of this class are taught by several faculty at Mason. This syllabus is indebted to <a href="http://rrchnm.org/robertson/hist390s15/">Stephen Robertson</a>, <a href="http://edwired.org/courses/h390sp13/syllabus/">Mills Kelly</a>, <a href="http://6floors.org/teaching/HIST390/fall2013/assignments/">Sharon Leon</a>, and <a href="http://www.dancohen.org/digitalpast/">Dan Cohen</a>. The mapping assignment is based on Brian Croxall’s “<a href="http://www.briancroxall.net/dh/assignments/mapping-mrs-dalloway/">Mapping Mrs. Dalloway</a>” assignment and conversations with <a href="http://cas.umkc.edu/history/faculty/cantwell.asp">Chris Cantwell</a>.</p>
<h3 id="general-policies">General policies</h3>
<p>See the <a href="http://catalog.gmu.edu/">George Mason University catalog</a> for general policies, as well as the university <a href="http://ctfe.gmu.edu/professional-development/mason-diversity-statement/">statement on diversity</a>. You are expected to know and follow George Mason’s policies on <a href="http://oai.gmu.edu/">academic integrity</a> and the <a href="http://oai.gmu.edu/understanding-the-honor-code/">honor code</a>. Please ask me if you have any questions about how these policies apply to this course. Please note the dates for dropping and adding this course from the <a href="http://registrar.gmu.edu/calendars/fall-2014/">academic calendar</a>.</p>
<h3 id="getting-help-and-accommodations">Getting help and accommodations</h3>
<p>There are many ways that you can get help at Mason. If you have any question about what kinds of help are available, please contact me.</p>
<p>If you are a student with a disability and you need academic accommodations, please see me and contact the Office of Disability Services at 703-993-2474 or <a href="http://ods.gmu.edu" class="uri">http://ods.gmu.edu</a>. All academic accommodations must be arranged through that office.</p>
<h3 id="plagiarism-and-cheating">Plagiarism and cheating</h3>
<p>There will be many opportunities for group work, but unless otherwise specified, you should work on your own for assignments. If you do receive help or cooperate on an assignment, all such work should be acknowledged explicitly.</p>
<p>In general, every source that you use should be acknowledged in a note or bibliography entry. Sources must be adequately paraphrased, meaning (at a minimum) that word choice, sentence and paragraph structure, and the order of ideas must be made your own. Whenever you use others’ exact words, you must mark them as such by quotation marks or block quotations with accompanying citations.</p>
<h3 id="phones-computers-tablets">Phones, computers, tablets</h3>
<p>While computing devices are welcome and encouraged in the classroom, they are to be used for course work and the tasks at hand. Students who use their devices to engage in activity that is not directly related to the coursework will not receive credit for participation that week.</p>
<h3 id="assignments">Assignments</h3>
<p>Please plan on doing all the readings, working through all exercises, completing any assignments, and installing necessary software before the start of each class.</p>
<p>I may change due dates or assignments. I will always give you plenty of notice of changes, which will always be intended for your benefit. Students must satisfactorily complete all assignments (including participation assignments) in order to pass this course.</p>
<h3 id="attendance">Attendance</h3>
<p>Participation will be a significant part of your grade. Your attendance is expected at every class. If you must be absent, I request that you notify me by e-mail in advance of class meeting. Even if you are absent, you must turn in assignments before the time when our class meets. After the first absence from class, the relevant portion of your grade for the class will be lowered for each absence. If you must miss a due date or an exam because of a medical or other emergency, fairness to the other students requires proper documentation.</p>
<h3 id="communications">Communications</h3>
<p>I am always glad to meet with you in person. You can make an appointment for office hours by <script type="text/javascript">

For most communications I prefer e-mail. I will reply to your messages within one business day (but never on a Sunday). I will send official course communications to your George Mason e-mail address, which you should check regularly. I will discuss grades only in person.</p>
<p>The online syllabus is the only authoritative version. Please consult it regularly.</p>
<h3 id="privacy">Privacy</h3>
<p>You will be required to make some of your work publicly available. If you wish, you may do so under a pseudonym to keep your identity private from the public, though I and the other students in the course will have access to your work.</p>
<h3 id="late-work">Late work</h3>
<p>I am willing to grant extensions for cause, but you must request an extension before the assignment’s due date. For every day or part of a day that an assignment is late without an extension, I may reduce your grade. Unexcused late work will almost certainly not receive any substantial comment or help. No work (other than final exams) will be accepted later than the last day that the class meets unless I have agreed otherwise.</p>
