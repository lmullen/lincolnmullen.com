  <h2 id="course-description">Course description</h2>
  <p>In this class, you will to learn to do history using digital tools. The course—which satisfies the <a href="http://masoncore.gmu.edu/general-education-at-mason-2/information-technology-1/">Mason Core IT
      requirement</a>—teaches the fundamentals of information technology by applying them to practical problems in
    history. Throughout the semester, you will work individually and with classmates on a series of projects about
    American history during the period of Reconstruction. You will learn how to do research online, but also how to put
    those sources in the context of other scholarly work. You will gather data, learn how to question it, analyze it,
    summarize it, and interpret it. You will create visualizations of datasets, including maps. You will learn how to
    present visual and textual sources online in web exhibits, and you will learn how to write and publish effectively
    online. Through learning by doing, you will gain both digital skills and the skills of a historian. This combination
    will be useful to you throughout your university career and in your future work.</p>
  <p>In this course you will</p>
  <ul>
    <li>learn the history of American Reconstruction,</li>
    <li>create historical scholarship using digital tools and resources, and</li>
    <li>publish historical scholarship on the web.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You will also master the <a href="http://masoncore.gmu.edu/general-education-at-mason-2/information-technology-1/">IT competencies</a> from
    the Mason Core:</p>
  <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
    <li>Students will be able to use technology to locate, access, evaluate, and use information, and appropriately cite
      resources from digital/electronic media.</li>
    <li>Students will understand the core IT concepts in a range of current and emerging technologies and learn to apply
      appropriate technologies to a range of tasks.</li>
    <li>Students will understand many of the key ethical, legal and social issues related to information technology and
      how to interpret and comply with ethical principles, laws, regulations, and institutional policies.</li>
    <li>Students will demonstrate the ability to communicate, create, and collaborate effectively using state-of-the-art
      information technologies in multiple modalities.</li>
    <li>Students will understand the essential issues related to information security, how to take precautions and use
      techniques and tools to defend against computer crimes.</li>

  <h2 id="assignments">Assignments</h2>
  <p><strong>Turn in all assignments on Blackboard.</strong> In the box for the assignment text, include the URL to your
    assignment or blog post.</p>
  <p>In this class you will create a number of smaller projects on the history of Reconstruction. Each of these projects
    will demonstrate a specific skill that you learned in class. At the end of the semester, you will combine them into
    a portfolio of materials. You will also write blog posts on various subjects. <strong>All assignments or blog posts
      given on Thursday are due before the start of class on Tuesday.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Quizzes (10%).</strong> On any day for which reading is assigned, I may give a short in-class quiz. You may
    use notes you have taken on the reading if they are on paper. If you take notes electronically, print them out.</p>
  <p><strong>Midterm exam (15%).</strong> There will be an in-class examination on Tuesday, March 21.</p>
  <p><strong>Blog (20%).</strong> For each assignment, write a well-argued blog post of approximately five hundred
    words, with correct prose with full sentences and paragraphs with topic sentences. Respond to the questions in the
    prompt thoroughly, but do not simply enumerate your answers. These posts are graded by completion. Thoughtful posts
    will receive full credit; others will receive no credit.</p>
  <p><strong>Skills assignments (9 @ 5% each = 45%).</strong> You will create nine small projects over the course of the
    semester. You should pick a single state which underwent Reconstruction and, to the extent that the sources
    available to you will allow it, focus your assignments on that state. Except for the Omeka assignments, embed these
    in a page on your WordPress website. Due dates and further instructions are listed on the schedule. These are the
    assignments: (1) metadata in Omeka; (2) exhibits and storytelling in Omeka; (3) database of Freedmen’s Bureau
    records; (4) georeferencing a historical map; (5) mapping data; (6) text mining WPA former slave narratives; (7)
    visualizing data; (8) creating a timeline of Reconstruction; (9) creating a portfolio of your other assignments for
    the course.</p>
  <p><strong>Participation (10%).</strong> You are expected to attend each class meeting and participate actively. Bring
    a laptop and power cord, so that you can follow along with instructions in class and work on assignments. Bring the
    textbook and a copy of any other readings to class on any day for which they are assigned.</p>

    <p>You are expected to participate actively in each class session. All devices are to be used only for course work.
      Students who are clearly disengaged from the course may be asked to leave.</p>
    <p>Students must satisfactorily complete all assignments (including participation assignments) in order to pass this
      course. You are expected to attend each class without exception. Grades will be reduced due to repeated absences.
      Complete all the readings before the start of each class. No unexcused late work will be accepted. You must
      request any extensions before assignments are due, and excused late work will receive a one letter grade penalty
      unless otherwise specified. No work will be accepted after the last day of class unless specifically assigned. I
      will discuss grades only in person during office hours.</p>
    <p>Unless otherwise specified, you should work on your own for assignments. If you do receive help or cooperate on
      an assignment, all such work should be acknowledged explicitly. In general, every source that you use should be
      acknowledged in a note or bibliography entry. Sources must be adequately paraphrased, meaning (at a minimum) that
      word choice, sentence and paragraph structure, and the order of ideas must be made your own. Whenever you use
      others’ exact words, you must mark them as such by quotation marks or block quotations with accompanying
