        <p>The relationship between religion and capitalism has long exercised historians of the United States, and
          before them it concerned the people whom historians study. In this class, you will meet many people whose
          religion led them to interact with capitalism in incredibly diverse ways. You will meet the Puritans whose
          work ethic supposedly created capitalism, but who insisted on resting on the Sabbath; Moravian missionaries
          who made converts and money; slaves, slaveowners, and abolitionists who all claimed the Bible when reckoning
          with the capitalist system of slavery; a Protestant writer who insisted that Jesus was a businessman, and
          Catholics who believed Jesus called them to a kind of socialism; African American preachers who marketed their
          recorded sermons; Jews who mass-manufactured matzah and created Yiddish socialism; an industrialist who wrote
          <em>The Gospel of Wealth</em>, and laborers who created churches for the working class; nineteenth-century
          consumers who turned gift-giving into a ritual, and a twenty-first-century television personality who turned
          consumption into therapy; converts who thought religion required poverty, and Prosperity Gospelers who thought
          it promised wealth. You will read primary sources from American history, secondary works in both religious
          history and the new history of capitalism, and excerpts from theorists of religion and capitalism. Through
          these readings and your own research project, you are invited make sense of this perpetual historical puzzle.
        </p>
        <h3 id="how-to-do-well-in-this-seminar">How to Do Well in This Seminar</h3>
        <p>This seminar will be a shared investigation into the history of religion and capitalism that will require you
          both to read broadly and to research with focus. In preparation for our meetings read broadly in the fields of
          both American religion and the history of capitalism. You will have to work to make connections between those
          two fields and to find shared themes across time, space, and religions. As we read in both fields, you will
          have to grasp the concepts borrowed from thinkers like Weber, Mauss, and Marx, and see whether they are useful
          for your own research. You should select a topic for research that is manageable within the scope of a
          semester but that sheds light on the broader themes we are discussing. I suggest that you settle on a general
          topic early in the seminar and devise a plan to scaffold your critical review assignments in service of your
          final project. Come talk to me as often as is helpful to you. I am also glad to meet in person. I am often in
          my office and we can make appointments to discuss the course.</p>
        <h3 id="required-books">Required Books</h3>
