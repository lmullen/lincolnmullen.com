      On my desk I keep one reference work within easy reach: the <i><a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/new-historical-atlas-of-religion-in-america-9780195091687?cc=us&lang=en">New
          Historical Atlas of Religion in America</a></i>. It is not just
      that I am fascinated by maps. When writing or teaching about religion,
      I try to remember the dictum that I first learned from Jane Kamensky:
      “events take place.” To bring place into my work, I need to remind
      myself constantly of the where and when of American religious history.

    </aside>

    <p>
      But I also keep in mind Laurie Maffly-Kipp’s memorably titled essay
      “If It’s South Dakota You Must Be Episcopalian.” In that essay
      Maffly-Kipp reviews several atlases of American religion and makes a
      number of telling critiques of the whole enterprise of mapping
      religion, and indeed mapping in the humanities generally. Those
      critiques can be lumped into two categories: sources and definitions.
      First, sources: “We are still limited by data that is partial,
      ambiguous, and clearly slanted toward things that can be counted and
      people that traditionally have been seen as significant.” In other
      words, our sources for making maps of religion aren’t very good, and
      the best sources let us make maps of groups that we already know a lot
      about. Second, definitions: Maffly-Kipp observes that our “our
      dazzling new technologies and spatial theories” might only have
      “brought us back to much more circumscribed definitions of religious
      experience.” In other words, map-making requires us to use
      denominational categories when the whole trend of religious history
      and religious studies is towards more complex, layered understandings
      of religion.

      The scholars who created the leading atlases of American religion
      often raised the same questions. When I look at the <i>New Historical
        Atlas</i> or Bret Carroll's <i>Routledge Historical Atlas of
        Religion in America</i>, I see their great ingenuity in dealing with
      these questions within the limits of mapmaking in print.
      But it seems to me that digital mapmaking permits us to escape some
      of the constraints of maps in print atlases and monographs.
      So my questions today are these: Can digital mapmaking let us make
      maps which address these theoretical critiques? How can we take the
      next step from the work of Gaustad and others, while taking into
      account Maffly-Kipp's concerns?

        America</i> (New York: Routledge, 2000).

    <p>
      I'll try to answer those questions by showing you two projects that I
      have worked on. The first is a class I taught on mapping Boston's
      religions from the American revolution to the 1880s. And—since I've
      done more interesting work since I submitted my abstract a year ago—I
      will also sketch out the sources and methods for digital maps of
      religion on a much larger scale.
    </p>

  </section>

  <section class="text">
    <p>
      My general argument is that there are large sources of data on
      American religion after the colonial period and before Word War II
      which historians have not used to make maps. Scholars have not passed
      over these sources because they are unaware of them, but because they
      could not meaningfully represent them in print maps. The problem is
      one of resolution. Print atlases could convey relatively few data
      points. Furthermore, because atlases can contain only so many maps,
      they have often been forced to set their chronological or geographic
      scope very large. By using these more detailed sources we are able to
      make maps which better approximate the sophisticated thinking about
      religious categories that we expect from our prose. These richer maps
      can tell us not just more, but more humanistic, things about religious
      history. To take advantage of these more comprehensive sources we need
      digital maps. To be sure, digital history has had more than its share
      of hubris, more than we have time to repent of today. But digital maps
      do offer the possibility for working at different scales, for
      displaying change over time, for integrating maps with our sources,
      and for crafting narratives with maps. While none of these advantages
      entirely solves with the problem of mapping humanistically, they do
      permit us to at least start to address these theoretical concerns.
    </p>

  <section class="text">
    <p>
      My first work to show you is a deep map of the history of religion in
      Boston. In the spring of 2014, I taught a course at Brandeis
      University on mapping the religions of Boston in the nineteenth
      century. In this project-based course, students did original research
      to locate congregations in Boston and created a map of the religious
      landscape of the city as it changed over time. Students looked at
      nineteenth-century maps of Boston, city directories, and
      denominational records to find the locations of about 235
      congregations. They then developed a metadata schema to handle the
      information they had researched. In other words, they had to design
      the categories for their maps and figure out how to represent change
      over time and ambiguity in the sources. Using <a href="http://omeka.org/">Omeka</a> and <a href="http://neatline.org/">Neatline</a>, students created records
      for the congregations, including information such as the date a
      congregation was formed and the date it disbanded, its street
      location, denomination, and any other relevant information, including
      citations. Many of the records included photographs or engravings of
      the church buildings. Churches were pegged to a timeline, so that
      changes in congregations could be shown dynamically. Students also
      georectified original maps to put beneath their congregations to show
      the changing landscape of the city. This was especially important for
      Boston, since large parts of the city were reclaimed from the
      harbor or the Back Bay during the middle of the nineteenth century.
      Finally, students created exhibits (online essays, really) about
      particular aspects of what they had learned from creating the map.
    </p>

    <aside>
      The term <em>deep map</em> has recently come into vogue. It refers to
      a map which not only visualizes data but permits access to the sources
      underlying that data, and perhaps also to maps which embed narratives.
      Deep maps usually embed a variety of ways of looking at a particular
      place. See also the <a href="http://lincolnmullen.com/teaching/">syllabus for the
        course</a>. I learned a lot about the pedagogy of teaching a class
      centered on a digital project (history class as shop class), but that
      is another discussion altogether. On the Boston landfill, see Nancy S.
      Seasholes, <i>Gaining Ground: A History of Landmaking in Boston</i>
      (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2003).

      <h2>Map of Boston Religions, 1800–1880</h2>

      <p>
        This map was created by the students in “Mapping Boston's Religions:
        A Digital History Seminar” at Brandeis University in spring 2014.
        See the <a href="http://omeka.lts.brandeis.edu/neatline/show/mapping-bostons-religions">standalone
          version of the map</a> for full functionality and for the student
        exhibits about their findings from the map.
      </p>

      <p>
        Try dragging the timeline to show the changing places of
        congregations. The georectified map layers should change as well.
        Clicking on individual congregations will show additional
        information about them, as will following the links to the Omeka
        site.

  <section class="text">
    <p>
      I wish to be cautious about about making historical claims from the
      map. The students were all excellent, but the class was very small;
      too small, probably, for the size of the project that we attempted. I
      can't claim that we identified all the congregations in the Boston for
      that eighty year period, which would have taken a team of graduate
      students much longer than a semester.
    </p>

    <p>
      But I can point out some of the methodological advantages of this kind
      of deep mapping. First, by animating the map we were able to see
      change over time. <a href="http://omeka.lts.brandeis.edu/exhibits/show/hist-144a--zi-jing-teoh">One
        student</a> who was interested in the Methodist congregations was
      able to chart their spread throughout the city. Methodists, like
      everybody else, started in the downtown section of the city. But as
      new land opened because of the Back Bay landfill, churches moved to
      the west. We identified photos of churches in the Back Bay where they
      were literally the only buildings in sight. By observing movements
      connected to photographs, we were able to discuss the significance of
      landscape—an observation only available through this kind of deep
      mapping.
    </p>

  </section>

  <section class="text">

    <p>
      Second, students learned from creating this map to think of religions
      as being part of an ecosystem. The map led to useful questions about
      how religious groups related to one another and to their environment.
      <a href="http://omeka.lts.brandeis.edu/exhibits/show/boston-synagogues">Another
        student</a> wrote about the disputes between the “Bayer” (i.e.,
      German) and the “Polander” (i.e., Polish) synagogues. She was able to
      identify many of the homes of the Jews who made up the membership of
      Congregation Ohabei Shalom. The split between these congregations over
      matters of culture and ritual later influenced the settlement of Jews,
      who lived in different neighborhoods of the city at different times.
      <a href="http://omeka.lts.brandeis.edu/exhibits/show/africans-in-boston">A
        third student</a> examined racial segregation in housing and
      churches along with interaction between black and white Baptist
      churches on Beacon Hill and in the North End.
    </p>


    <p>
      Finally students thought deeply about the categories we had to use. So
      far from mapping obscuring the categories we used, it was the central
      means of discussing them. One day we read Ralph Waldo Emerson's
      “Divinity School Address,” with its call for his audience to be
      “yourself a newborn bard of the Holy Ghost,—cast behind you all
      conformity.” One student observed that
      Emerson would not have found much use in our class project, because we
      were mapping congregations rather than individuals, institutions
      rather than prophets. Our map featured a city, when Emerson would have
      called us to “nature.” It was a brilliant observation, because it used
      our reading of Emerson’s text to interrogate the assumptions about
      religion and society that underlay our class project: assumptions that
      I had made, and also assumption inherent to mapmaking. But our
      discussion also led us to conclude
      that though Emerson had a point about individualism, many
      people in Boston would not have so easily discarded the
      congregations of which they were members.
    </p>

      (Boston: Houghton,
      Mifflin, 1898), 136, 143. I have written about this in a forthcoming
      article, “Using Metadata and Maps to Teach the History of Religion,”

      24, no. 3 (2014): 34–40 (<a href="http://lincolnmullen.com/downloads/pdf/mullen.using-metadata-and-maps.preprint.pdf">PDF

  <section class="text">

    <p>
      While the map by no means fully resolves the critiques that I cited
      earlier, it does start to address them. In particular, this map is
      based on very different sources than the maps in Gaustad, Barlow, and
      Dishno's <i>New Historical Atlas of Religion</i>. Where they used data
      from the Census Bureau for the majority of their national maps, we
      were able to use just about any kind of source and to capture many
      more details about it within the Omeka records. And though our map
      was still beholden to more or less the same denominational categories
      as the <i>New Historical Atlas</i>, we were able to turn our attention
      to ecosystems and interactions.
    </p>


    <p>
      All of our methodological differences from the <i>New Historical
        Atlas</i> depended on looking at a city rather than a nation. Is
      there a way to extend these kind of methods to a larger scale?
    </p>

    <p>
      Most of the maps in the Gaustad atlas depict a particular denomination
      in a given year using aggregated data from the U.S. Census Bureau
      about the number of congregations in a county. These maps are thus
      able to give an overview of the regional prominence of particular
      religious groups county by county. The map of Congregationalists in
      the 1850 census is typical.
    </p>

    <aside>
      The maps in the <i>New Historical Atlas</i> are unreliable for change
      over time, however, because they inexplicably change the color scales
      from year to year (let alone from denomination to denomination). Thus
      some maps appear to show the growth of a particular religious group,
      when what actually happened is impossible to discern visually given
      the changing scales.
    </aside>

    <p>
      Thanks to the <a href="https://www.nhgis.org/">National Historic
        Geographic Information System</a> (NHGIS) at the University of
      Minnesota, it is easy to reproduce any of the maps in the Gaustad
      atlas which are based on the census. NHGIS has digitized the
      aggregate-level census data and keyed it to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile">shapefiles</a> of
      United States in each decade. We can use that data to create web (or
      print, for that matter) maps which are visually similar to Gaustad's
      and which depict the exact same data.

        Dishno, and Barlow.

        This map and all other maps in this presentation were made with
        Elijah Meeks's <a href="https://github.com/emeeks/d3-carto-map">d3-carto-map</a>
        library, which in turn depends on Mike Bostock's <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3.js</a> visualization library.

  <section class="text">
    <p>
      The mere translation of the Gaustad maps from print to digital gains
      us nothing. Beyond the strong presence of Congregationalism in New
      England and its spread to parts of Ohio and Illinois, we cannot learn
      much from county-level maps. Were we to zoom into Massachusetts,
      we would learn that each county has 25 churches or more (how many
      more?) but we would not know where those churches were located, how
      close they were to other Congregationalist churches (let alone
      churches of other denominations) or how many congregants they had. The
      problem is that the county is too coarse for meaningful maps.
    </p>

    <aside>
      The sharp-eyed critic will notice that the print Gaustad both includes
      a legend and uses the Albers projection, which is much preferable to
      the default Mercator projection in my reproduction.
    </aside>

    <p>
      But there is much more detailed information available to us. I mean
      most obviously the records of many denominations, which often contain
      detailed information about membership, and usually at a minimum
      contain long lists of congregations. Often they even include
      information about Canada. Once these lists are digitized and
      geocoded, they can provide maps of much greater resolution than the
      aggregate census data.
    </p>

    <aside>
      We need not limit ourselves to denominational records in print. Any
      source that contains repeated references to place can be mapped. (See,
      for instance, Brian Croxall's <a href="http://www.briancroxall.net/dh/assignments/mapping-mrs-dalloway/">class
        assignment</a> to map Virginia Woolf’s Mrs. Dalloway. I have <a href="http://lincolnmullen.com/projects/paulists-map/">used similar
        techniques</a> to map manuscript records from the Paulist Fathers;
      Jannelle Legg has mapped the <a href="http://jannellelegg.com/portfolio/FinalProject/CMDM.html">Church

      <h2>Congregationalists in 1853</h2>
      <p>
        This map is based on data for 2,212 congregations in the United
        States and Canada transcribed from the <i><a href="https://archive.org/details/americancongrega04amer">Year-Book
            of the American Congregational Union for the Year 1854</a></i>
        (New York, 1854). The geocoded data is available on <a href="https://github.com/lmullen/demographics-religion">GitHub</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Clicking on a congregation will show more information about it.
        Follow the link in the pop-up to see the original record. Try zooming
        the map to various places:

        <em>N.B.</em> The locations of congregations are precise only the

        congregation, the congregations have been randomly distributed
        within the city.

      Leaving aside for a moment the ability to pan and zoom the map, to
      access additional information by clicking on the congregations, and to link out to primary
      source, how much more information does this map contain than the
      equivalent map in the <i>New Historical Atlas</i>? The <i>Atlas</i>
      has 137 counties with at least one Congregationalist church: it thus
      makes 137 meaningful marks on the page. This map from denominational
      records has 2,212 Congregationalist churches in the United States and
      Canada. Also, the map is able to depict not just the existence
      of a congregation, but also its size in members. This is a
      32-fold increase in the amount of information conveyed in the map.
      For comparison, that is the difference between
      an 800 x 600 pixel CRT monitor and two 4K monitors.

      This map really does let us see things that we could not in the map
      based on aggregate census data. For one, we can see how New England's
      cities were complex ecosystem of small and large Congregationalist
      churches. Only a few miles separated the pastor-less sixteen members
      of a church in North Chelsea from the 603 members of Park Street
      Church. Second, there is a sharper line between the Massachusetts
      border with New York than between churches in Michigan and Canada. And
      third, we can see the effects of personality: Oberlin's eleven hundred
      Congregationalists drawn by Charles Finney far outweigh the membership
      of any other church west of Massachusetts.

      Another use of these maps is the ability to set them in
      motion over time. This effectively lets us make scores of maps where
      before we only had one.

        This map shows the spread of Congregationalists over time based on
        the records in the <i><a href="https://archive.org/details/americancongrega04amer">Year-Book
            of the American Congregational Union for the Year 1854</a></i>
        (New York, 1854). Only some associations
        reported the founding dates for churches, so this map shows
        primarily Massachusetts, Maine, and Connecticut.

      One other observation about sources. Denominational records for the
      nineteenth century vary widely from denomination to denomination, and
      can even vary in detail from year to year within the same
      denomination. So another source of information available to historians
      are the published census data up through 1926 (or for some
      denominations, through 1936). You will recall that I criticized the
      county-level data from the census as obscuring as much as it reveals.
      In order to create those aggregate counts, the Census Bureau had to
      keep track of data at the level of congregations. The published census
      reports contain counts of churches and members in cities with more
      than 25,000 people. Compared to the attention paid to cities like
      Boston, few of us have done work on Council Bluffs, Iowa, or
      Woonsocket, RI, but it is possible to know with some specificity about
      those cities. For example, in the published 1926 census report there
      are 292 cities containing records for 215 religions or denominations.

      Though I have not yet tracked them down, it is also possible to access
      the raw returns for the 1926 Census. For an extraordinary number of
      congregations in the United States, there are census returns giving
      addresses and often counts of members. The Census Bureau used these in
      compiling their aggregate reports, but they can in turn be sources for
      detailed maps.

      In conclusion, the scholars who created print atlases did
      extraordinary work, not least given the constraints of the medium of
      print. But print could only show a limited amount of data. Given how
      little data we’ve actually had to work with, it's not surprising that
      the maps we have are open to criticisms. Some of these problems are
      inherent in the nature of mapping—you'll never find Emerson's "newborn
      bard of the Holy Ghost" on a map like this. But at least some of the
      critiques can begin to be solved by producing far more detailed maps
      of American religion, which in turn let us ask more complex questions
      about ecosystems, interactions, and the layering of space and
      identities.
