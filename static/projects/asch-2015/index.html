        On my desk I keep one reference work within easy reach: the <i><a 
            href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/new-historical-atlas-of-religion-in-america-9780195091687?cc=us&lang=en">New 
            Historical Atlas of Religion in America</a></i>. It is not just 
        that I am fascinated by maps. When writing or teaching about religion, 
        I try to remember the dictum that I first learned from Jane Kamensky: 
        “events take place.” To bring place into my work, I need to remind 
        myself constantly of the where and when of American religious history.

      <p>
        But I also keep in mind Laurie Maffly-Kipp’s memorably titled essay 
        “If It’s South Dakota You Must Be Episcopalian.” In that essay 
        Maffly-Kipp reviews several atlases of American religion and makes a 
        number of telling critiques of the whole enterprise of mapping 
        religion, and indeed mapping in the humanities generally.  Those 
        critiques can be lumped into two categories: sources and definitions.  
        First, sources: “We are still limited by data that is partial, 
        ambiguous, and clearly slanted toward things that can be counted and 
        people that traditionally have been seen as significant.” In other 
        words, our sources for making maps of religion aren’t very good, and 
        the best sources let us make maps of groups that we already know a lot 
        about. Second, definitions: Maffly-Kipp observes that our “our 
        dazzling new technologies and spatial theories” might only have 
        “brought us back to much more circumscribed definitions of religious 
        experience.” In other words, map-making requires us to use 
        denominational categories when the whole trend of religious history 
        and religious studies is towards more complex, layered understandings 
        of religion.

        The scholars who created the leading atlases of American religion 
        often raised the same questions. When I look at the <i>New Historical 
          Atlas</i> or Bret Carroll's <i>Routledge Historical Atlas of 
          Religion in America</i>, I see their great ingenuity in dealing with 
        these questions within the limits of mapmaking in print.
        But it seems to me that digital mapmaking permits us to  escape some 
        of the constraints of maps in print atlases and monographs.
        So my questions today are these: Can digital mapmaking let us make 
        maps which address these theoretical critiques? How can we take the 
        next step from the work of Gaustad and others, while taking into 
        account Maffly-Kipp's concerns?

        I'll try to answer those questions by showing you two projects that I 
        have worked on. The first is a class I taught on mapping Boston's 
        religions from the American revolution to the 1880s. And—since I've 
        done more interesting work since I submitted my abstract a year ago—I 
        will also sketch out the sources and methods for digital maps of 
        religion on a much larger scale.
      </p>

    <section class="text">
      <p>
        My general argument is that there are large sources of data on 
        American religion after the colonial period and before Word War II 
        which historians have not used to make maps.  Scholars have not passed 
        over these sources because they are unaware of them, but because they 
        could not meaningfully represent them in print maps. The problem is 
        one of resolution. Print atlases could convey relatively few data 
        points. Furthermore, because atlases can contain only so many maps, 
        they have often been forced to set their chronological or geographic 
        scope very large. By using these more detailed sources we are able to 
        make maps which better approximate the sophisticated thinking about 
        religious categories that we expect from our prose. These richer maps 
        can tell us not just more, but more humanistic, things about religious 
        history. To take advantage of these more comprehensive sources we need 
        digital maps. To be sure, digital history has had more than its share 
        of hubris, more than we have time to repent of today. But digital maps 
        do offer the possibility for working at different scales, for 
        displaying change over time, for integrating maps with our sources, 
        and for crafting narratives with maps.  While none of these advantages 
        entirely solves with the problem of mapping humanistically, they do 
        permit us to at least start to address these theoretical concerns.

    <section class="text">
      <p>
        My first work to show you is a deep map of the history of religion in 
        Boston. In the spring of 2014, I taught a course at Brandeis 
        University on mapping the religions of Boston in the nineteenth 
        century. In this project-based course, students did original research 
        to locate congregations in Boston and created a map of the religious 
        landscape of the city as it changed over time. Students looked at 
        nineteenth-century maps of Boston, city directories, and 
        denominational records to find the locations of about 235 
        congregations. They then developed a metadata schema to handle the 
        information they had researched. In other words, they had to design 
        the categories for their maps and figure out how to represent change 
        over time and ambiguity in the sources. Using <a 
          href="http://omeka.org/">Omeka</a> and <a 
          href="http://neatline.org/">Neatline</a>, students created records 
        for the congregations, including information such as the date a 
        congregation was formed and the date it disbanded, its street 
        location, denomination, and any other relevant information, including 
        citations. Many of the records included photographs or engravings of 
        the church buildings. Churches were pegged to a timeline, so that 
        changes in congregations could be shown dynamically. Students also 
        georectified original maps to put beneath their congregations to show 
        the changing landscape of the city. This was especially important for 
        Boston, since large parts of the city were reclaimed from the 
        harbor or the Back Bay during the middle of the nineteenth century. 
        Finally, students created exhibits (online essays, really) about 
        particular aspects of what they had learned from creating the map.  
      </p>

      <aside>
        The term <em>deep map</em> has recently come into vogue. It refers to 
        a map which not only visualizes data but permits access to the sources 
        underlying that data, and perhaps also to maps which embed narratives.  
        Deep maps usually embed a variety of ways of looking at a particular 
        place. See also the <a 
          href="http://lincolnmullen.com/teaching/">syllabus for the 
          course</a>. I learned a lot about the pedagogy of teaching a class 
        centered on a digital project (history class as shop class), but that 
        is another discussion altogether. On the Boston landfill, see Nancy S. 
        Seasholes, <i>Gaining Ground: A History of Landmaking in Boston</i> 
        (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2003).

          This map was created by the students in “Mapping Boston's Religions: 
          A Digital History Seminar” at Brandeis University in spring 2014.  
          See the <a

          exhibits about their findings from the map.

        <p>
          Try dragging the timeline to show the changing places of 
          congregations. The georectified map layers should change as well. 
          Clicking on individual congregations will show additional 
          information about them, as will following the links to the Omeka 
          site.

        I wish to be cautious about about making historical claims from the 
        map. The students were all excellent, but the class was very small; 
        too small, probably, for the size of the project that we attempted.  I 
        can't claim that we identified all the congregations in the Boston for 
        that eighty year period, which would have taken a team of graduate 
        students much longer than a semester.
      </p>

      <p>
        But I can point out some of the methodological advantages of this kind 
        of deep mapping. First, by animating the map we were able to see 
        change over time. <a 
          href="http://omeka.lts.brandeis.edu/exhibits/show/hist-144a--zi-jing-teoh">One 
          student</a> who was interested in the Methodist congregations was 
        able to chart their spread throughout the city. Methodists, like 
        everybody else, started in the downtown section of the city. But as 
        new land opened because of the Back Bay landfill, churches moved to 
        the west.  We identified photos of churches in the Back Bay where they 
        were literally the only buildings in sight. By observing movements 
        connected to photographs, we were able to discuss the significance of 
        landscape—an observation only available through this kind of deep 
        mapping.
      </p>

    </section>

    <section class="text">

      <p>
        Second, students learned from creating this map to think of religions 
        as being part of an ecosystem. The map led to useful questions about 
        how religious groups related to one another and to their environment. 
        <a 
          href="http://omeka.lts.brandeis.edu/exhibits/show/boston-synagogues">Another 
          student</a> wrote about the disputes between the “Bayer” (i.e., 
        German) and the “Polander” (i.e., Polish) synagogues. She was able to 
        identify many of the homes of the Jews who made up the membership of 
        Congregation Ohabei Shalom. The split between these congregations over 
        matters of culture and ritual later influenced the settlement of Jews, 
        who lived in different neighborhoods of the city at different times.  
        <a 
          href="http://omeka.lts.brandeis.edu/exhibits/show/africans-in-boston">A 
          third student</a> examined racial segregation in housing and 
        churches along with interaction between black and white Baptist 
        churches on Beacon Hill and in the North End.
      </p>


      <p>
        Finally students thought deeply about the categories we had to use. So 
        far from mapping obscuring the categories we used, it was the central 
        means of discussing them. One day we read Ralph Waldo Emerson's 
        “Divinity School Address,” with its call for his audience to be 
        “yourself a newborn bard of the Holy Ghost,—cast behind you all 
        conformity.” One student observed that 
        Emerson would not have found much use in our class project, because we 
        were mapping congregations rather than individuals, institutions 
        rather than prophets. Our map featured a city, when Emerson would have 
        called us to “nature.” It was a brilliant observation, because it used 
        our reading of Emerson’s text to interrogate the assumptions about 
        religion and society that underlay our class project: assumptions that 
        I had made, and also assumption inherent to mapmaking. But our 
        discussion also led us to conclude
        that though Emerson had a point about individualism, many 
        people in Boston would not have so easily discarded the 
        congregations of which they were members.

      <p>
        While the map by no means fully resolves the critiques that I cited 
        earlier, it does start to address them. In particular, this map is 
        based on very different sources than the maps in Gaustad, Barlow, and 
        Dishno's <i>New Historical Atlas of Religion</i>. Where they used data 
        from the Census Bureau for the majority of their national maps, we 
        were able to use just about any kind of source and to capture many 
        more details about it within the Omeka records. And though our map 
        was still beholden to more or less the same denominational categories 
        as the <i>New Historical Atlas</i>, we were able to turn our attention 
        to ecosystems and interactions.
      </p>


      <p>
        All of our methodological differences from the <i>New Historical 
          Atlas</i> depended on looking at a city rather than a nation. Is 
        there a way to extend these kind of methods to a larger scale?
      </p>

      <p>
        Most of the maps in the Gaustad atlas depict a particular denomination 
        in a given year using aggregated data from the U.S.  Census Bureau 
        about the number of congregations in a county. These maps are thus 
        able to give an overview of the regional prominence of particular 
        religious groups county by county. The map of Congregationalists in 
        the 1850 census is typical.
      </p>

      <aside>
        The maps in the <i>New Historical Atlas</i> are unreliable for change 
        over time, however, because they inexplicably change the color scales 
        from year to year (let alone from denomination to denomination). Thus 
        some maps appear to show the growth of a particular religious group, 
        when what actually happened is impossible to discern visually given 
        the changing scales.
      </aside>

      <p>
        Thanks to the <a href="https://www.nhgis.org/">National Historic 
          Geographic Information System</a> (NHGIS) at the University of 
        Minnesota, it is easy to reproduce any of the maps in the Gaustad 
        atlas which are based on the census. NHGIS has digitized the 
        aggregate-level census data and keyed it to <a 
          href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile">shapefiles</a> of 
        United States in each decade. We can use that data to create web (or 
        print, for that matter) maps which are visually similar to Gaustad's 
        and which depict the exact same data.

        The mere translation of the Gaustad maps from print to digital gains 
        us nothing. Beyond the strong presence of Congregationalism in New 
        England and its spread to parts of Ohio and Illinois, we cannot learn 
        much from county-level maps. Were we to zoom into Massachusetts, 
        we would learn that each county has 25 churches or more (how many 
        more?) but we would not know where those churches were located, how 
        close they were to other Congregationalist churches (let alone 
        churches of other denominations) or how many congregants they had. The 
        problem is that the county is too coarse for meaningful maps.

        The sharp-eyed critic will notice that the print Gaustad both includes 
        a legend and uses the Albers projection, which is much preferable to 
        the default Mercator projection in my reproduction.

        But there is much more detailed information available to us. I mean 
        most obviously the records of many denominations, which often contain 
        detailed information about membership, and usually at a minimum 
        contain long lists of congregations. Often they even include 
        information about Canada. Once these lists are digitized and
        geocoded, they can provide maps of much greater resolution than the 
        aggregate census data.

        We need not limit ourselves to denominational records in print. Any 
        source that contains repeated references to place can be mapped. (See, 
        for instance, Brian Croxall's <a 
          href="http://www.briancroxall.net/dh/assignments/mapping-mrs-dalloway/">class 
          assignment</a> to map Virginia Woolf’s Mrs. Dalloway. I have <a 
          href="http://lincolnmullen.com/projects/paulists-map/">used similar 
          techniques</a> to map manuscript records from the Paulist Fathers; 
        Jannelle Legg has mapped the <a 
          href="http://jannellelegg.com/portfolio/FinalProject/CMDM.html">Church 
          Mission to Deaf-Mutes</a> from the very unsystematic reports of the 
        missionaries.

          This map is based on data for 2,212 congregations in the United 
          States and Canada transcribed from the <i><a 
              href="https://archive.org/details/americancongrega04amer">Year-Book 
              of the American Congregational Union for the Year 1854</a></i> 
          (New York, 1854). The geocoded data is available on <a

          Clicking on a congregation will show more information about it.  
          Follow the link in the pop-up to see the original record. Try zooming 
          the map to various places:
        </p>

          <em>N.B.</em> The locations of congregations are precise only the 
          city. To avoid overlap, when a city was home to more than one 
          congregation, the congregations have been randomly distributed 
          within the city.

        Leaving aside for a moment the ability to pan and zoom the map, to 
        access additional information by clicking on the congregations, and to link out to primary 
        source, how much more information does this map contain than the 
        equivalent map in the <i>New Historical Atlas</i>? The <i>Atlas</i> 
        has 137 counties with at least one Congregationalist church: it thus 
        makes 137 meaningful marks on the page. This map from denominational 
        records has 2,212 Congregationalist churches in the United States and 
        Canada. Also, the map is able to depict not just the existence 
        of a congregation, but also its size in members. This is a 
        32-fold increase in the amount of information conveyed in the map.
        For comparison, that is the difference between 
        an 800 x 600 pixel CRT monitor and two 4K monitors.

        This map really does let us see things that we could not in the map 
        based on aggregate census data.  For one, we can see how New England's 
        cities were complex ecosystem of small and large Congregationalist 
        churches.  Only a few miles separated the pastor-less sixteen members 
        of a church in North Chelsea from the 603 members of Park Street 
        Church. Second, there is a sharper line between the Massachusetts 
        border with New York than between churches in Michigan and Canada. And 
        third, we can see the effects of personality: Oberlin's eleven hundred 
        Congregationalists drawn by Charles Finney far outweigh the membership 
        of any other church west of Massachusetts.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another use of these maps is the ability to set them in 
        motion over time. This effectively lets us make scores of maps where 
        before we only had one.

        One other observation about sources. Denominational records for the 
        nineteenth century vary widely from denomination to denomination, and 
        can even vary in detail from year to year within the same 
        denomination. So another source of information available to historians 
        are the published census data up through 1926 (or for some 
        denominations, through 1936). You will recall that I criticized the 
        county-level data from the census as obscuring as much as it reveals.  
        In order to create those aggregate counts, the Census Bureau had to 
        keep track of data at the level of congregations. The published census 
        reports contain counts of churches and members in cities with more 
        than 25,000 people.  Compared to the attention paid to cities like 
        Boston, few of us have done work on Council Bluffs, Iowa, or 
        Woonsocket, RI, but it is possible to know with some specificity about 
        those cities. For example, in the published 1926 census report there 
        are 292 cities containing records for 215 religions or denominations.

        The reliability of the censuses of religion has been defended in

        on Religion,” <i>Sociology of Religion</i> 53, no. 1 (1992): 91–95,

      <p>
        Though I have not yet tracked them down, it is also possible to access 
        the raw returns for the 1926 Census. For an extraordinary number of
        congregations in the United States, there are census returns giving 
        addresses and often counts of members. The Census Bureau used these in 
        compiling their aggregate reports, but they can in turn be sources for 
        detailed maps.

        In conclusion, the scholars who created print atlases did 
        extraordinary work, not least given the constraints of the medium of 
        print. But print could only show a limited amount of data. Given how 
        little data we’ve actually had to work with, it's not surprising that 
        the maps we have are open to criticisms.  Some of these problems are 
        inherent in the nature of mapping—you'll never find Emerson's "newborn 
        bard of the Holy Ghost" on a map like this.  But at least some of the 
        critiques can begin to be solved by producing far more detailed maps 
        of American religion, which in turn let us ask more complex questions 
        about ecosystems, interactions, and the layering of space and 
        identities.
