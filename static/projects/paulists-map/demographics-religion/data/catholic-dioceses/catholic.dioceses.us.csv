# Explanation: "Diocese" is the name of the diocese, with the name of the state when necessary to clear up ambiguity. "Date.erected" is the date that the diocese was created. "Date.metropolitan" is the date the diocese became a metropolitan see or sometimes just an archdiocese. "Rite" is the ritual observed in the diocese. Regions or institutions with ordinary jurisdiction but not episcopal character are not included. Code's data extends only to 1963. Date after 1963 comes from the Catholic Hierarchy website cited. With the exception of Puerto Rico, Latin American dioceses, some of which are much older the United States dioceses, are not included. I have corrected some errors in Code's list.
