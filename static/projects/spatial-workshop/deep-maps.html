          <h2>Space vs. place</h2>
          <p>A <strong>deep map</strong> is a map of a place rather than a space. Geographers often distinguish between
            <em>place</em> and <em>space</em>. Space is the grid of reference that we use in making maps: 31.7833° N,
            35.2167° E is a pointer in space. Place, on the other hand, is the meaning that we make out of space. The
            latitude and longitude are the space, but the place is Jerusalem—a place with countless contested meanings
            attached to it. In a recent brief essay on place, for example, the anthropologist Tanya Luhrman <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/25/opinion/how-places-let-us-feel-the-past.html">writes that</a>
            “roughly 100 tourists [to Jerusalem] a year become sufficiently overwhelmed by spiritual experiences that
            they end up in a mental health center. They see themselves as biblical characters or as messiahs, or they
            feel that they have been given a special task, like moving the Western Wall.” For different people the same
            thing happens elsewhere: “Japanese tourists experience Paris syndrome when they arrive in the City of Light,
            a symbol of the glory of the West. There is a Florence syndrome. Visitors collapse in front of the Fra
            Angelicos in the San Marco Convent, or feel weak-kneed in the Uffizi.”
          </p>
          <p>As a further illustration of the different between space and place, our modern coordinate reference systems
            take their origin point 0°, 0°, a point in the Atlantic Ocean off the West coast of Africa: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_Island">Null Island</a>. This reproduction of the thirteenth-
            century Ebstorf map, however, takes as its central point Jerusalem, and freights the city with symbolic
            religious imagery.</p>

            <img src="img/ebstorf.jpg" alt="A reproduction of the Ebstorf Map (full size)." />
            <p class="caption">A reproduction of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebstorf_Map">Ebstorf Map</a>

          </div>
          <p>The geographer Tim Cresswell defines places as follows:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Place is how we make the world meaningful and the way we experience the world. Place, at a basic level,
              is space invested with meaning in the context of power. This process of investing space with meaning
              happens across the globe at all scales, and has done throughout human history. It has been one of the
              central tasks of human geography to make sense of it.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>One of the challenges in making humanistic maps is to create maps that capture place, not just space. One
            of the keys to creating such a map is thinking of places as “gatherings” or “assemblages.” One author writes
            how “places gather things”:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Places gather … . Minimally, places gather things in their midst – where “things” connote various animate
              and inanimate entities. Places also gather experiences and histories, even languages and thoughts. Think
              only of what it means to go back to a place you know, finding it full of memories and expectations, old
              things and new things, the familiar and strange, and much more besides. What else is capable of this
              massively diversified holding action?…The power belongs to place itself, and it is a power of gathering.<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>A deep map tries to uncover these gatherings in the pursuit of explaining the multiple meanings behind a
            place.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="deep-maps" class="section level2">
          <h2>Deep maps</h2>
          <p>Deep mapping is the attempt to map places.<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> A
            deep map may take several forms, including things that are not a map at all. For instance, in some uses of
            the term, a “deep map” may be an essay exploring the meaning of a place. But in our case we are going to
            create a deep map in the sense of a map that seeks to uncover the assemblages of a place by putting multiple
            media elements together on a map.<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
          <p>We are aiming to create a map that offers these features:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>represents ambiguities (not least of space)</li>
            <li>has different layers, preferably representing not just different data but different kinds of data</li>
            <li>represents multiple perspectives/voices</li>
            <li>offers narratives</li>
            <li>concerned with multiple variables (e.g., power, race, class, gender, emotion, etc.)</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="omeka-and-neatline" class="section level2">
          <h2>Omeka and Neatline</h2>
          <p>In order to create our deep map we will use two pieces of software: Omeka and Neatline. <a href="http://omeka.org/">Omeka</a> is a content management system to create “complex narratives and share
            rich collections.” Unlike most web publishing platforms, Omeka has been created by scholars at the <a href="http://chnm.gmu.edu/">Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media</a> for other scholars,
            libraries, archives, and museums. <a href="http://neatline.org/">Neatline</a> is a suite of mapping and
            spatial plugins for Omeka created by created by the <a href="http://scholarslab.org/">Scholars’ Lab</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Together Omeka and Neatline are a good
            platform because they let us create rich spatial collections, which we can both place on a map and weave
            into narratives.</p>
          <div id="working-with-omeka-and-neatline" class="section level3">
            <h3>Working with Omeka and Neatline</h3>
            <p>You will receive an account to <a href="http://lincolnmullen.com/projects/deepmap/">Omeka
                installation</a> we will be using.</p>
            <p>Both Omeka and Neatline have excellent documentation. You will need to be able to do two main tasks:
              create an Omeka item, and then associate that Omeka item with a Neatline representation on the map. You
              should begin by reading Miriam Posner’s “<a href="http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/up-and-running-with-omeka">Up and Running with
                Omeka.net</a>,” though you can skip ahead to “Add a new item to your archive.” Then read the Omeka
              documentation about “<a href="https://omeka.org/codex/Managing_Items_2.0">Managing Items</a>” and the
              Neatline documentation <a href="http://docs.neatline.org/records-overview.html">on records</a>.</p>

        <div id="workshop-exercise" class="section level2">
          <h2>Workshop exercise</h2>
          <p>For a class, a deep map might be a semester-long project of uncovering the meaning of a particular place.
            For example, I taught a class on nineteenth-century religion in Boston in which we create a <a href="http://omeka.lts.brandeis.edu/neatline/fullscreen/mapping-bostons-religions">map of religious
              institutions</a> in Boston, accompanied by online student essays closely tied to our class map about what
            they had learned about Boston’s religious history.</p>
          <p>For our workshop, we will create a deep map of the college and town that we are in.</p>
          <p>We will need to make the following decisions about our deep map during the workshop. See Neatline’s
            documentation about <a href="http://docs.neatline.org/neatline-stylesheets.html">Styling Exhibits with
              Neatline-Flavored CSS</a>, which provides a way of implementing these decisions.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>How will we distinguish between what different contributors have added?</li>
            <li>What will the aesthetics of the map (e.g., color, size, shape) mean?</li>
            <li>What base layers do we need?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Some of the things that our deep map might gather:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A place without a name on a map</li>
            <li>A place for music / the arts</li>
            <li>A place for entertainment</li>
            <li>A place you wish you had gone / hadn’t gone</li>
            <li>A place you have been once and only once</li>
            <li>A place you go by yourself / with friends / with family / with colleagues</li>
            <li>A classroom you teach in</li>
            <li>Your office</li>
            <li>A place to eat</li>
            <li>A place for athletics</li>
            <li>A place for kids / teens / college students / adults / the elderly</li>
            <li>A place for worship</li>
            <li>A place for the rich / the middle class / the poor</li>
            <li>A segregated / integrated place</li>
            <li>The farthest you go in a day</li>
            <li>An industrial place</li>
            <li>An architecturally interesting building</li>
            <li>An ugly place</li>
            <li>A political place</li>
            <li>A place where English is not spoken</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Types of “media” to consider including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Experiences</li>
            <li>Photographs</li>
            <li>Data (from government/university sources)</li>
