          <h2>Mapping, digital humanities, and the disciplines</h2>
          <p>The <a href="http://whatisdigitalhumanities.com/">digital humanities</a> have a number of common
            specialties, among them text mining, network analysis, public history/humanities, and mapping. As Stephen
            Robertson has <a href="http://drstephenrobertson.com/blog-post/the-differences-between-digital-history-and-digital-humanities/">pointed
              out</a>, mapping is one of the most commonly used techniques in digital history, whereas digital literary
            studies has often focused more on text mining. But while digital history may have a special affinity for
            mapping, mapping and the spatial turn more generally have had a significant impact across the humanities
            disciplines. For an introduction to spatial humanities and the disciplines, you can read Jo Guldi’s
            introduction “<a href="http://spatial.scholarslab.org/spatial-turn/">What Is the Spatial Turn?</a>,” which
            discusses the importance of the spatial turn for eight academic disciplines, and Richard White’s essay “<a href="https://web.stanford.edu/group/spatialhistory/cgi-bin/site/pub.php?id=29">What is Spatial
              History?</a>,” which provides an introduction for the historical discipline. The list of projects on the
            <a href="literacy.html">mapping literacy page</a> provides many example of how mapping has influenced
            humanities research and teaching.
          </p>
          <p>Mapping has many uses for humanities scholars. Humanists sometimes use maps to tell stories by tracking the
            movement of individuals and groups through space and time. Another kind of humanities mapping focuses on
            “deep mapping,” which seeks to demonstrate how the multiple meanings of places is constructed. A third kind
            of humanities mapping is driven by data analysis: it seeks to use information, often but necessarily
            quantitative, to understand spatial patterns in our sources. Most of these forms of maps can be thought of
            either displaying or discovering knowledge. Sometimes the aim of the map is to present the answer to a
            question, other times it is to attempt to ask a question and find out the answer. Like any research process,
            mapping leads to a cycle of asking and answering questions, which in turn lead to new questions.</p>
          <p>Digital maps—both through desktop GIS software and web mapping—have put the tools of mapmaking directly
            into the hands of scholars and their students. Digital maps provide a number of affordances that aid
            scholarship. First, their availability and relative accessibility means that the researchers who have not
            been formally trained in cartography are able to make maps for themselves. Digital maps can be rapidly
            iterated, so scholars can create experimental maps and maps that are likely to “fail” as part of their
            process of asking and answering questions. The interactivity of digital maps permits scholars to filter the
            data that is displayed, to change the scale of the map from the globe to the individual building, and to
            embed other kinds of sources within map. More generally digital maps let scholars organize abundant sources
            spatially in order to bring together disparate sources that might not otherwise be comparable, and to
            extract additional information from scarce sources. However, these techniques take time to master, and once
            the techniques are mastered, you must reflect on how maps will influence your teaching and research. It is
            the aim of this workshop to provide you with the necessary skills at making maps in order to use them within
            your discipline.</p>
          <p>As you go through the workshop, consider which kinds of maps are most likely to be useful to your students.
            Do you want them to explore a dataset, and perhaps even create the spatial data themselves, in order to do
            their own research? Do you wish them to present their arguments to you in the form of a map? Or do you wish
            them to think about the construction of place in a novel, or a historical source, or a painting?</p>
        </div>
        <div id="how-the-workshop-will-proceed" class="section level2">
          <h2>How the workshop will proceed</h2>
          <p>There is a common problem in working with spatial data (or really, any kind of data at all). Once one has
            gained a reasonable competence at making maps, the actual process of making the maps can go very quickly.
            Far more time is spent creating, cleaning, and preparing data. Furthermore, the process of creating maps is
            repeatable from one map to the next. Once one has learned how to make a certain kind of map, making the
            second or third or tenth map is much easier. But every new project brings the same challenges of finding and
            preparing data. This work is highly specific to the datasets or primary sources in question. The skill of
            creating, cleaning, and manipulating data can be learned, but the techniques are hard to distill down to a
            tutorial or set of steps, since it requires your own judgment. This reality should offer a certain kind of
            comfort to humanities scholars. The work we do as scholars in finding and interpreting data consumes the
            major part of the time we work.</p>
          <p>
          <div id="htmlwidget-3078" style="width:100%;height:192px;" class="grViz"></div>
          <script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-3078">{"x":{"diagram":"\n      digraph nicegraph {\n      graph [overlap = true,\n             rankdir = LR,\n             label = <The Process of Mapping<BR/><BR/> >,\n             fontname = Ubuntu,\n             labelloc = \"t\"\n]\n\n      node [shape = box,\n           overlap = true,\n           fontname = Ubuntu,\n           fontsize = 10]\n      A [label = \"Find/create data\"]\n      B [label = \"Clean/tidy data\"]\n      C [label = \"Explore data\"]\n      D [label = \"Map data\"]\n      E [label = \"Interpret map\"]\n\n      A->B->C->D->E [splines = \"line\"]\n      C->B [splines = \"curved\"]\n      E->D [splines = \"curved\"]\n      D->C [splines = \"curved\"]\n      E->A [splines = \"curved\"]\n      }\n      ","config":{"engine":"dot","options":null}},"evals":[]}</script>
          </p>
          <p>This does present a pedagogical challenge in learning about mapmaking, however. Once one has learned how to
            make maps, one still might stumble in learning how to prepare the data. For this reason, this workshop will
            work backwards from the workflow diagrammed above. We will begin by with literacy: the skill of reading and
            interpreting maps, both modern digital maps created by scholars and maps as sources. Having gained that
            skill, we will work on creating simple maps using cleaned and prepared data. Then we will work on the skills
            of acquiring, cleaning, and preparing spatial data. We will also learn how to manipulate data: that is, to
            change its projection, to join spatial data to other data, and so on, so that the data can be readily
            mapped.</p>
          <p>You will have to decide for yourself which of these skills you wish to introduce to the classroom. I
            recommend focusing on map making for shorter assignments and and then gathering data only for longer
            assignments. You should distinguish between necessary complexity (which requires scholarly insight) and
            incidental complexity (which requires putting up with the cruft around technology). Whatever incidental
            complexity can be eliminated, must be eliminated.</p>
          <p>But for this workshop will not hide any of the unglamorous or tedious, sometimes frustrating work that goes
            into preparing maps. If you wish to successfully teach mapmaking to your students, you will need to develop
            those skills. This will be even more the case if you use these techniques in your own research. But at the
            same time, you may also choose in the lessons that you prepare to focus on the mapmaking and the generating
            of humanities insights, so that your students receive the most reward for their effort.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="the-spatial-humanists-toolbox" class="section level2">
          <h2>The spatial humanist’s toolbox</h2>
          <p>Working in the spatial humanities requires you to use a wide range of tools. Even though some programs will
            claim that they can do everything, they can’t. Cultivating knowledge of what kind of tool to use to do what
            job is crucial, especially when deciding what tools you will use in your courses, and which tools you can
            rely on for your research.</p>
          <p>You can think of spatial tools as lying on a spectrum from consumer to professional tools. Consumer tools
            are intended to be “user friendly” (though they rarely live up to that claim). They invariably feature a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface">graphical user interface</a> (GUI), which
            makes common actions fairly easy to perform but which makes uncommon actions impossible to do. They almost
            always assume that you are working with data which is clean and ready to use. Often, but not always, they
            are intended to have a flatter learning curve, but skilled users are not generally much more productive than
            intermediate users. With notable exception such as ArcGIS, professional tools are often open-source, and so
            free. Professional tools often have a steep learning curve, which is repaid by flexibility of us.
            Professional tools respect their users by letting them inspect what is happening at any given point and by
            letting them control every option. To do any real work beyond canned examples, you will need to use
            professional tools to prepare the data. As a teacher, however, you may choose to prepare data for your
            students so that they can use consumer tools exclusively. When working with spatial data you will almost
            certainly need many tools, but as a teacher, you should probably limit the number of tools you teach to your
            students.</p>
          <p>These are the types of tools that you will use during this workshop.</p>
          <div id="gis" class="section level3">
            <h3>GIS</h3>
            <p>The archetypical tool for doing spatial work is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system">geographic information system</a> from
              which the discipline of GIS takes its names. These GIS tools are large GUI programs installed on a
              computer. They are as near to being comprehensive as any tool, and handle data from its raw stage to the
              final presentation of maps. The best known GIS system is <a href="http://www.arcgis.com/features/">ArcGIS</a>, a Windows-only, very expensive commercial program
              from ESRI. If you have access to ArcGIS, it probably comes through your university. An alternative is <a href="http://www.qgis.org/en/site/">QGIS</a>, an open-source GIS program available on Mac, PC, and
              Linux. This application has matured in recent years so that it is a viable alternative to ArcGIS. While
              there are differences between the two programs, what you learn in one will be generally applicable to the
              other. For this workshop, we will use <a href="qgis.html">QGIS to make maps</a>.</p>

          <div id="web-mapping-tools" class="section level3">
            <h3>Web mapping tools</h3>
            <p>The online counterpart to GIS software are websites which offer the ability to create maps. These range
              from free consumer tools like <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/">Google Maps</a>, to mapping
              tools written specifically for humanists such as <a href="http://palladio.designhumanities.org/">Palladio</a>, to services for web mapping such as <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/education/">Mapbox</a>, to online versions of desktop GIS software such as
              <a href="http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/arcgisonline">ArcGIS Online</a>, to tools that aim to replace
              GIS software entirely such as <a href="https://cartodb.com/">CartoDB</a>. Such tools are often easier to
              use than GIS software, though considerably less powerful. They can be an especially good choice for
              teaching, since they do not require students to install any software and since they produce maps intended
              for the web. For this workshop, we will use <a href="data-maps.html">CartoDB to make data maps</a>.

            <h3>Command line tools</h3>
            <p>For many tasks involving spatial data, it can be more convenient to use a command line tool. By
              specifying a commmand at the terminal, one can quickly and reliably peform very powerful actions. For
              instance, the command below uses a program from the <a href="http://www.gdal.org/">Geospatial Data
                Abstraction Library</a> (GDAL/OGR) to convert a file from one format to another using a command like
              this one:</p>
            <pre><code>ogr2ogr -f &quot;GeoJSON&quot; countries.geojson ne_110m_admin_0_countries.shp</code></pre>

            </div>
            <p>While command line tools have a steep learning curve, they are essential for performing certain tasks,
              especially preparing data. For this workshop, we will use GDAL/OGR to <a href="spatial-data.html">manipulate spatial data</a>.</p>

          <div id="programming-languages" class="section level3">
            <h3>Programming languages</h3>
            <p>The most advanced yet most powerful way to create maps is using computer programming langagues. Languages
              such as <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a>, <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>, and <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/">JavaScript</a>, along with popular libraries such as <a href="http://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a> and <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3.js</a> permit you to create

              words, download these files in the following order, and run the install packages for each. (We will work
              on this during the workshop.)
              <ul>
                <li><a href="http://www.kyngchaos.com/files/software/frameworks/GDAL_Complete-1.11.dmg">GDAL 1.11</a>
                  (~40MB)</li>

                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><a href="https://www.google.com/earth/">Google Earth Desktop</a>.</li>
            <li>A plain text editor. For Mac I recommend <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/">TextWrangler</a>. For Windows, <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">NotePad++</a>.</li>
            <li>A program to edit spreadsheets and CSV files. Excel will do, but I find <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/">Libre Office</a> to be more reliable.</li>
            <li>Windows users should install <a href="https://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a> if they wish to use command
              line tools.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>In addition, there are a few things which it would be nice to have but which are optional.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A website/blog hosted on a server that you can control. This will let you publish your maps to the web
              without the security restrictions of free hosting. If you don’t have one already, <a href="https://portal.reclaimhosting.com/aff.php?aff=004">Reclaim Hosting</a> is a web hosting provider
              that serves academics and students well. If you use Reclaim Hosting, you may wish to <a href="https://portal.reclaimhosting.com/knowledgebase.php?action=displayarticle&amp;id=2">install
                WordPress</a> using Reclaim’s installer.</li>
            <li>An FTP/SFTP client for accessing websites. On Mac and Windows I recommend <a href="https://cyberduck.io/?l=en">Cyberduck</a>.</li>
            <li><a href="http://www.gdal.org/">GDAL/OGR</a>. This set of command line programs offers many tools for
              manipulating spatial data. Note that if you install QGIS on a Mac according to the instructions above, you
              will already have install GDAL/OGR.</li>
          </ul>
          <div id="a-note-on-operating-systems" class="section level3">
            <h3>A note on operating systems</h3>
            <p>There are three common operating systems (or families of operating systems): Windows, Mac OS X, and
              GNU/Linux and Unix. While there are major differences between Macs and Linux, they are more alike than
              different in that they share the same foundational *nix underpinnings. Windows, on the other hand, is a
              world apart, as different from Macs and Linux as English is from Mandarin. When working with web-based
              tools in the browser, this should make no difference. But if you are working on Windows, you might
              consider installing <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">Virtual Box</a> and <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop">Ubuntu Desktop</a>.</p>

        <div id="what-you-should-use-in-class" class="section level2">
          <h2>What you should use in class</h2>
          <p>For use in class, I recommend trying to keep as much of your work in the web as possible. Students will
            come to class with every variety of technology, from Windows tablets to Mac laptops to Android phones. The
            web is the one common denominator that all of these platforms can use at once. As you go through the
            workshop, consider what kinds of software you would be able to support as you teach. This will depend in
            large part on which kinds of maps you ask your students to create and which kinds of technologies you feel
            comfortable supporting.</p>
