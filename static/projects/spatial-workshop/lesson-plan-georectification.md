title: Georectification
...

## Class learning objectives

Students will learn how to read historical maps as sources, and will note how places changed over time.

## Connection to course learning objectives

This project should serve as a reference tool for the course readings. These georectified maps may also be a component of a deep map.

-   A literature class might create a set of maps for a place described in the works read in a class.
-   A history class might create a set of georectified maps showing how the places studied changed over the course of the period covered by the class.

## Before class: student tasks

-   Identify a map to be georectified from the David Rumsey collection (or other suitable collection)

## Before class: instructor tasks

-   Identify maps to be georectified (if students are not being asked to do so)
-   Practice georectification with a map that can be warped with only three or four control points.
-   Prepare questions to be asked after georectifying a map (see interaction/practice)

## Hook

Students should be given a sense of ownership over their group's maps, so they feel an obligation to the larger class project.

## Demo/Introduction

Point to get across in the demonstration:

-   The basic theory behind georectification (perhaps using Ben Schmidt's subway maps)
-   How to add control points
-   How to warp the map
-   How and where to add more control points to fix a poorly warped map
-   How to export the map

## Interaction/practice

Students may work in groups on different maps of the same place (e.g., as chronological layers for a place) or different maps from adjacent places (e.g., different neighborhoods in a city, or states in a country). The goal is to put together the work of the different groups to create a class project that is larger than the whole, and which can be referred to throughout the class.

Students should also be asked to provide interpretations of the georectified map. Sample questions:

-   What has changed? What has stayed the same?
-   What point was the mapmaker trying to make? What information was the mapmaker trying to provide? Does georectification illuminate how the mapmaker constructed place?
-   What places can you identify on the georectified map (e.g., towns, boundaries, buildings)?

## Points to get across

-   How georectified maps shows change over time
-   How comparing a contemporary map and a historical map demonstrate the constructed nature of both

## Potential pitfalls

-   Some maps just don't rectify well.
-   If asked to chose their own maps, students may not be able to find one on their chosen topic.
