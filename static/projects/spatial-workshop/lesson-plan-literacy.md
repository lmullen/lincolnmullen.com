## Class learning objectives

Students will become familiar with web maps as a scholarly resource and will be able to read them critically. They will learn the grammar common to maps.

## Connection to course learning objectives

Before students can create maps they need to understand what kinds of maps are worth creating. This lesson aims to create student interest in mapping.

## Before class: student tasks

Identify one map (perhaps excluding Google Maps, Bing Maps, MapQuest, etc.) that the student has used in the past month.

## Before class: instructor tasks

Identify a handful of maps, preferably some within and some outside of the course content. These amps should contain some positive and some negative examples.

## Hook

Option 1: Ask several students to demo the maps that they have brought to class. (Or, this could be part of the interaction/practice.)

Option 2: Demonstrate a scholarly map which illustrates themes in the course content.

## Demo/Introduction

Depending on the map chosen, ask students to identify its key features.

-   What argument does this map make?
-   How does it communicate its argument?
-   What do you have to know in advance to understand this map?

## Interaction/practice

In small groups, students will explore at least two interactive maps. They will try to answer the same questions as above.

## Points to get across

1.  Maps work by aligning multiple sources of information to a spatial grid.
2.  Maps are a representation of reality not the reality itself.
3.  Maps are powerfully persuasive, but must be read critically.

Depending on which map is chosen, you may wish to make a point about the discipline-specific content.

## Assessment

The effectiveness of this lesson will be determined by how critically students read maps in future weeks.
