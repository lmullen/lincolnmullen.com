## Class learning objectives

Students will learn to think spatially about a text relevant to the course. Students will also learn how to construct a narrative that takes space into account.

## Connection to course learning objectives

The text, chosen by students or the instructor, will be about the course content. The connection to the course content will be even stronger if the students learn to 

## Before class: student tasks

- Students will need to sign up for a Google Account.
- Students may need to select a text.
- Students will need to prepare a list of the places mentioned in their texts, with corresponding page numbers or citations so they can look them up again.
They should also begin to gather relevant images.

## Before class: instructor tasks

- The instructor may need to assign texts to students, or at least prepare a list of texts for students to choose from.
- The instructor may need to assign students to groups.
- The instructor will need to provide instructions on how to find places within the text.

## Hook

The beginning of class should reveal how text the class has already read has a previously unnoticed spatial component. 

## Demo/Introduction

The instructor can create a minimal (two or three slide) narrative map in class using a text that the class has already read. The aim is to demonstrate the tool, how to find places in the text, and how to make decisions about what to include and exclude from the narrative. 

## Interaction/practice

Students will begin to create their narrative maps in class.

## Points to get across

- One has to read a text considering it spatially.
- Specific points about the importance of space for particular texts in the course.
- Comparison of how space matters differently for each of the texts that the students chose.

## Potential pitfalls

- Students may come to class without a Google account. Working in groups can mitigate this problem.
- Students may not have prepared the spatial information about their source.

## Assessment

- Excellent work will apply thinking about space to other texts read in class.
- Good work will identify all the places in a text, and explain how place is used within a narrative or argumentative framework. 
- Adequate work will merely identify the places in a text.
