        <p>The most important skill students can learn about maps in the humanities is spatial literacy. How does one
          read a map? This can mean quite literally introducing students to the basic conventions of maps. But more
          importantly it means learning how to read maps the past as primary sources, and how to read maps from scholars
          as secondary sources, and how to read texts with an eye to their spatial contexts.</p>
        <div id="what-do-maps-do" class="section level2">
          <h2>What do maps do?</h2>
          <p>I like to begin my first session on maps by asking students to bring a map (whether digital or print) that
            they have used to class. I then ask them to show it to the class and explain what about the map has value or
            meaning to them. Students may or may not bring a wide variety of maps. In fact, it might be pedagogically
            useful if they all bring one kind of map. The vast majority of students are familiar with Google Maps, so
            you can be guaranteed at least one person will bring that map.</p>

                Map of the National Mall</a>, showing many layers of data arranged spatially: land use, streets,
              buildings, photographs, text and reviews, traffic.</p>
          </div>
          <p>I try to direct students to a few basic principles about the map. You might ask the students to think more
            carefully about the Google Map than they are accustomed to. What does this map do, and how? What are the
            main features of the map?</p>
          <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
            <li>The map has layers. The map proper, or base layer, shows several different layers (though the user
              cannot disaggregate them) such as land use, buildings, street names. We could choose several different
              base layer maps, such as street or satellite view. (Later we will use <a
                href="https://www.mapbox.com/">MapBox</a> to create our own base layer.) The base layer seems natural
              through design and repeated use. But the ability to switch the base layer demonstrates how constructed
              everything about the map is: a map for cars, a map for bikes, a map of public transportation, and a map of
              the terrain for walking are entirely different. There are many other layers too: real-time or typical
              traffic, photographs from users, reviews of businesses, satellite imagery.</li>
            <li>The maps pans and zooms. This seems obvious, but it is the most remarkable thing about the map. The
              ability of the map to change its scale, from the building to the globe (or a Mercator projection of the
              globe) is the most humanistic thing about this map, because it lets us think at several different scales.
            </li>
            <li>The map is aware of the user. I can click the “location” icon and send my current position to the map.
              This feature is even more powerful when the map is mobile.</li>
            <li>The map is utterly unaware of time.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Every
              piece of the map is presented in the eternal present. After all, its chief value is that it does not go
              out of date, like a Rand McNally atlas. But we have no way of seeing how things were different in the
              past.</li>
            <li>The map is open for addition, but not for amendment. We are able to use the base layers, and even add to
              the reviews. But the actual map itself is controlled by the Google corporation. (We can compare this
              Google map to the <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/66418944#map=18/38.89066/-77.02028">Open
                Street Map</a> version of the same place.)</li>
            <li>The map forces everything to a spatial grid. This is the most basic concept about the map, though it is
              below the surface. What makes permits the map to coordinate all of this information is, quite literally, a
              set of coordinates. This is the central concept in mapmaking in the humanities. As Stephen Robertson <a
                href="http://quod.lib.umich.edu/d/dh/12230987.0001.001/1:8/--writing-history-in-the-digital-age?g=dculture;rgn=div1;view=fulltext;xc=1#8.2">explains</a>
              about his map of Harlem:</li>
          </ol>
          <blockquote>
            <p>GIS organizes and integrates sources on the basis of their shared geographic location … . Geospatial
              tools involve not only maps but also databases. The power of such tools is that they use geographic
              location to integrate material from a wide range of disparate sources. “What is important about assigning
              a geographic reference to data,” Karen Kemp points out, “is that it then becomes possible to compare that
              characteristic, event, phenomenon, etc. with others that exist or have existed in the same geographic
              space. What were previously unrelated facts become integrated and correlated.”<a href="#fn2"

              the maps, their audience, their interfaces, among other axes of comparison.</li>
            <li>What is the grammar of mapping? In other words, what are the typical symbols that mapmakers use, and how
              are they can they be put in relation to one another?</li>
            <li>Which maps stood out to you? Why? Which maps were typical?</li>
            <li>Which of these would be good examples to use with students?</li>
            <li>Which maps were the worst? What made them bad?</li>
            <li>How do scholarly maps differ from non-scholarly maps?</li>
            <li>What kind of data is amenable to mapping? What kinds of topics</li>
            <li>What accompanies maps? Who controls their interpretation? What is their role in making an argument?</li>
            <li>How do recent web maps compare to maps made online in the past few years? How can maps be made
              sustainable?</li>
            <li>Which of these maps are in your discipline? Which maps might be helpful models for your discipline?</li>
