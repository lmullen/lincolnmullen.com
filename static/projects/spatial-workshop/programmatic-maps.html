          <h2>Why make maps with code?</h2>
          <p>All of the maps that we have created so far in this workshop have been created using graphical user
            interfaces (GUIs). However, there is an entirely different way to create maps using computer programming
            languages. Consider the example code below. These five lines of code create the map below of a encounters
            between American and French vessels during the Quasi War.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> For now, don’t get hung up on the details of the code.</p>

          <p>There is a significant difference between the way we created this map and the way that we created maps
            using GUIs. In the GUIs, we had to point and click, and it is difficult to explain what we did and to
            reproduce or repeat it. Yet by making this map with code, we can in principle inspect and explain every step
            along the way, even if the language takes some getting used to. For example, we can read this code and
            observe that the line <code>addTiles()</code> adds the Open Street Map tiles to the map, and we can surmise
            that if we left that line out we would not get any tiles, and if we added some more information to the
            function that we could get different tiles. Or, we can observe that the <code>addCircles()</code> function
            adds small blue circles to the map, and we can surmise that we could use that function to add large red
            circles, or even that changing the function to something different might give us a different kind of marker
            altogether. The principle is that computer code lets us specify exactly what we want.<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
          <p>Using computer code also opens the possibility that we can manipulate our data in much more powerful ways
            than our GUI tools allowed. Consider this example.</p>

          <p>These few lines of code might appear a little cryptic, but by looking at them we can figure out that we are
            taking our Quasi War data (in the variable called <code>quasi</code>) and keeping only the events that
            happened before the end of the year 1798.</p>
          <p>You can certainly make all the maps that you need using the GUI tools that we have explored in this
            workshop, and that may be the right decision for you. But writing your own code gives you a powerful,
            flexible, and precise means of creating maps. The aim of this part of the workshop is to expose you to the
            possibilities of what you can do by learning the rudiments of a programming language.</p>

        <div id="which-language-and-libraries" class="section level2">
          <h2>Which language and libraries?</h2>
          <p>If you are going to use code to make maps, then you should almost certainly invest your time in learning a
            language that lets you make interactive maps for the web. All web pages are created using (at a minimum) <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/">HTML</a> to structure the page, <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/">CSS</a> to tell the browser what the page should look like, and <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/">JavaScript</a> to add interactivity. Web maps like the one above use
            the popular <a href="http://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet.js</a> library, which uses JavaScript to create the
            map.<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> You could certainly follow one of the
            many tutorials available for Leaflet in order to create a web map.</p>
          <p>But for this workshop, we are going to use the <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R programming
              language</a>. R is a language whose strength is data analysis, and it will let us create interactive maps
            that use JavaScript more easily than we could do in JavaScript itself. (The examples on this page above are
            in R.) At the workshop you will be provided with access to a server running R so that you do not need to
            install any software on your computer. But because R is open source, you can install all of the tools that
            we are using if you wish. You can find <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R itself</a> here; I also
            recommend <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a> for use with R. You may wish to consult this <a href="http://lincolnmullen.com/projects/dh-r/">book-in-progress about R</a>.</p>
