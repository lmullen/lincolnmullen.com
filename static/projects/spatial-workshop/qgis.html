          <h2>About QGIS</h2>
          <p>QGIS is an advanced tool, comparable to <a href="http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/arcgis-for-desktop">ArcGIS</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> In this workshop we will use data from <a href="https://www.nhgis.org/">NHGIS</a> which has U.S. Census data to create a <a href="data-maps.html">data map</a> similar to what we did earlier. Working with NHGIS will serve as an
            introduction to navigating large spatial datasets that are available from governments or academic sources.
            But because the NHGIS shapefiles are too large to be usable in CartoDB<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> we will create a similar kind of map in QGIS.</p>
          <p>QGIS, like CartoDB, uses map layers. (You might compare it to Photoshop in this regard.) You might
            initially find it surprising that QGIS does not start with a base layer, such as a Google Maps. QGIS expects
            you to add every layer for yourself.</p>

          <h2>Getting Data from NHGIS</h2>
          <p>We will use data from the <a href="https://www.nhgis.org/">National Historic Geographic Information
              System</a> (NHGIS), a project from the Minnesota Population Center to digitize U.S. Census data and
            connect it to spatial data. You should navigate through NHGIS in order to download data for yourself. To
            download data from NHGIS, you will need to create an account, then navigate the <a href="https://data2.nhgis.org/main">data finder</a>. See the <a href="https://www.nhgis.org/user-resources/users-guide">NHGIS User’s Guide</a> for details. After
            downloading those files, you should unzip them into a directory. Be sure to include both census data and
            shapefiles. The geographic level (i.e., county, state, or census tract) and the year must match one another
            for the census data and the spatial data. Or you can download this <a href="data/nhgis0040_csv.zip">assortment of data from 1890 U.S.
              Census</a> (CSV files) with accompanying <a href="data/nhgis0040_shape.zip">county boundaries</a> (a
            shapefile).<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

          <h2>Adding a Vector Layer to QGIS</h2>
          <p>Each data set can be added to QGIS as a layer. The type of layer will depend on the kind of data that you
            are using. (See the <a href="spatial-data.html">spatial data</a> section for an explanation.) We will begin
            by adding the county boundaries for the U.S. in 1890. Since these are in a shapefile, they are a vector
            layer.</p>
          <p>To add the layer, click “Layer &gt; Add Layer &gt; Add Vector Layer.” You will then navigate to the
            directory where the NHGIS shapefile is stored.<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
          <div class="figure">
            <img src="img/qgis-select-file.png" alt="Selecting a shapefile to add as a vector layer in QGIS." />
            <p class="caption">Selecting a shapefile to add as a vector layer in QGIS.</p>
          </div>
          <p>After loading the shapefile, it will be displayed as a layer in QGIS.</p>
          <div class="figure">
            <img src="img/qgis-shapefile-loaded.png" alt="A shapefile after being loaded into QGIS." />
            <p class="caption">A shapefile after being loaded into QGIS.</p>
          </div>
          <p>There are a number of things you can do now that QGIS is displaying data. You can pan and zoom using the
            tools in the tool bar. It is particularly useful to right click on the layer in the list of layers to the
            left and choose “Zoom to layer.” Using the “identify features” tool, you can click on individual counties
            and see the data associated with them.</p>
          <p>We are going to do two things: inspect the data associated with the layer, and change how the layer appears
            on the map based on the data.</p>
          <p>First, to see the data associated with the shapefile, you can right click on the layer and choose “Open
            Attribute Table.” A window will pop up with a table similar to this.</p>
          <div class="figure">
            <img src="img/qgis-attributes.png" alt="The attribute table of a county shapefile in QGIS." />
            <p class="caption">The attribute table of a county shapefile in QGIS.</p>
          </div>
          <p>Notice the way that this data is structured. There is one row for each “feature” in the shapefile, in this
            case, one row for each county. Each county is associated with a set of variables, and each variable is
            stored in a column. These variables can have a variety of kinds of information associated with them: in this
            case there are text (i.e., string) fields as well as numeric fields. The kinds of information are important
            too. Some of the fields are place names, such as <code>NHGISNAM</code> for the county name; others are
            geographic information, like <code>SHAPE_AREA</code> for the area of the county in square meters. Yet others
            seem cryptic, such as <code>GISJOIN</code>, but these fields provide an unique identifier that lets us
            connect this spatial data to other kinds of data. This table could also contain information that might be of
            interest in mapping, such as the population of the county, but it does not. (For instance, the Natural Earth
            data, linked from the <a href="resources.html">resources page</a> include population data and other fields.)
            We will eventually have to join that information to the shapefile ourselves.</p>
          <p>Second, let’s change the way that the map is displayed. Instead of displaying the map based on the random
            colors assigned it by QGIS, we will assign the colors on the map to data in the attributes. You can do this
            by right clicking on the layer in the browser, then clicking “properties” and the “style” tab. QGIS calls
            the way that data is displayed its “symbol.” The symbol is normally the same for each feature in a layer.
            For instance, if all we wanted was to change the color and border of the boundaries, we could do so by
            selecting the “single symbol” option. This would be appropriate if we were only interested in the
            boundaries, or if we had, say, one shapefile for schools, another for churches, and so on, and wanted to
            represent each by a different symbol. In our case we want to pick the “graduated symbol” option, meaning
            that we are going to assign each feature to a bin associated with a color. By selecting the column to be the
            <code>SHAPE_AREA</code>, we are saying that the color should be determined by that variable. The number of
            “classes” is the number of bins. The “mode” is the way we determine what the boundaries of the bins should
            be. In this case we will use the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenks_natural_breaks_optimization">Jenks natural breaks algorithm</a>
            which tries to make each bin as distinct as possible from every other bin, while making the items in each
            bin as much alike as possible.<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> There are a
            number of color ramps to choose from, most taken from the <a href="http://colorbrewer2.org/">Color Brewer
              palettes</a>. Clicking “classify” assigns our counties to bins.
          </p>
          <div class="figure">
            <img src="img/qgis-graduated.png" alt="" />

          </div>
          <p>We get the following map as a result. It shows the counties classified by their size. We can inspect the
            map and see that the bigger counties do in fact receive a darker color.</p>

              the area of a shape can distort its apparent significance.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div id="joining-data" class="section level2">
          <h2>Joining data</h2>
          <p>But we want to create a map of more interesting information than the area of counties. To do that we need
            to use the data that we downloaded from NHGIS as a CSV. Try opening the file
            <code>nhgis0040_ds27_1890_county.csv</code> in a program like LibreOffice or Excel. It should look like
            this.
          </p>
          <div class="figure">
            <img src="img/nhgis-csv.png" alt="A CSV containing data from NHGIS." />
            <p class="caption">A CSV containing data from NHGIS.</p>
          </div>
          <p>The first thing to notice about this file is that the first column, <code>GISJOIN</code>, contains the same
            kind of code that we saw in the attributes table of our shapefile. This key identifies each county in space
            and time. In other words, <code>G0100010</code> represents Autauga County, Alabama, in 1890;
            <code>G2700270</code> represents Clay County, Minnesota, in 1890, and so on. This is the key to joining the
            data in our spatial data (the shapefile) to our census data (the CSV file). We can see other data as well:
            the name of the county, and so on. But the information that is actually of interest to us is contained in
            columns with cryptic names such as <code>AUM001</code>. To learn what these names mean, we have to use the
            codebook that is associated with out data file. The codebook is contained in the
            <code>nhgis0040_ds27_1890_county_codebook.txt</code> file. Opening up the codebook in a text editor lets us
            know what the columns mean. Now we are ready to join the data.
          </p>
          <div class="figure">
            <img src="img/qgis-codebook.png" alt="An NHGIS codebook." />
            <p class="caption">An NHGIS codebook.</p>
          </div>
          <p>To join the data, we need to load the CSV into QGIS. We can do this by choosing the “Layer &gt; Add Layer
            &gt; Add Delimited Text Layer” menu option, then navigating to our file. If the file had spatial information
            (e.g., latitude and longitude) we could let QGIS know where to find it. But this file has no spatial
            information so we will select “no geometry.”</p>
          <div class="figure">
            <img src="img/qgis-delimited.png" alt="Adding a CSV file to QGIS." />
            <p class="caption">Adding a CSV file to QGIS.</p>
          </div>
          <p>Now we have both layers in QGIS and need to join them together. To do that, we will right click on the
            original shapefile layer, select “Properties,” and click the “Joins tab.” Earlier we noticed that both the
            shapefile and the CSV file had a field called <code>GISJOIN</code>. We need to specify which layer we are
            joining, then let QGIS know to use the <code>GISJOIN</code> column in both datasets. Note that your data
            will not always be so clean and well-organized as this. In a different data set, for instance, you might
            have to join a CSV of country data to a shapefile of countries using their respective columns with the names
            of the countries, and inevitably there will be some names that will need to be standardized.</p>
          <div class="figure">
            <img src="img/qgis-join.png" alt="Joining a CSV file to a shapefile in QGIS." />
            <p class="caption">Joining a CSV file to a shapefile in QGIS.</p>
          </div>
          <p>Once we have completed the join, we can reopen the shapefile’s attribute table. Where before we only had
            geographic information, now we have access to all of the columns that were in the shapefile. We can create a
            graduated symbol as we did above. In this case, we can use the column <code>AVL016</code>, which gives us
            the number of people born in Germany by county.</p>

          <p>One of the most important skills to learn in using technology for scholarly research is how to read the
            manual successfully. You may wish to read the guide that QGIS provides: “<a href="http://docs.qgis.org/2.0/en/docs/gentle_gis_introduction/">A Gentle Introduction to GIS</a>.” There
            are many tutorials for QGIS online; see the <a href="resources.html">resources page</a> for a list. QGIS
            provides many advanced techniques which you should look over.</p>

              <p>Your institution may have a (rather expensive) subscription to ArcGIS. ArcGIS is indeed a powerful
                tool, and perhaps in some ways the de facto standard among cartographers. However, I prefer QGIS for two
                reasons. The first is a strong preference for open-source software for scholarly research and teaching.
                Second, in order to use ArcGIS, you would likely have to use your institutional subscription in a
                Windows computer lab, while QGIS permits students to use the software on their own machines. That said,
                what you learn about QGIS should be broadly transferable to ArcGIS should you choose to use it for
                yourself.<a href="#fnref1">↩</a></p>
